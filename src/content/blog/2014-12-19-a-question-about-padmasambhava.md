I am reading *“Tantric Practice in Nying-Ma.”* by Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoche. In the book I found this:

> *“He originated this transmission, and five different types of beings - gods, dragons, demons, lichavis, and yakshas - passed on the transmission after receiving it from him.”*

I needed to know more about this, so I asked a trusted source this question: Are dragons here nagas, and where do humans come in?

This was his answer:

There were five who met with Vajrapani on Mount Malaya.



- a god named Yasasvi Varapal.



- a naga known as King Taksaka.



- a rakshasa ogre,  Matyaupayika,  who wrote it all down in melted beryl on golden plates and hid it in the sky.



- a yaksha, or nature spirit, by the name of Ulamukha.



- and Vimalakirti, a human awareness holder of the Lichavi clan.
