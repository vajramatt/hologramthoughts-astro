My eyes were closed yesterday for a couple of hundred miles. The car was zooming along the interstate headed home. The sun was shining and the lanes were clear, so my wife was listening to her music and letting the cruise-control do its thing. When I wasn't sleeping I was wondering who I am. What makes me 'me'. Am I the guy who can find goodness in almost anyone? Am I the guy who allows himself to become irate with people who can not help themselves? Am I somewhere in between those extremes? I am not the person I was last year, much less the kid I was at 17. I know I am not the person I will be in six months as well. So 'who' am I? If I am really being mindful of my environment and the everyday magic around me, aren't I already more than I was? If I suffer a head injury and my disposition changes radically, am I a 'new' person? Today I think I am generally a nice, good person. What if I had a chemical deficiency and suddenly became withdrawn and belligerent? Would that guy be me? Am I simply the thoughts and feelings that this person is having at any given moment? Confusing huh?
