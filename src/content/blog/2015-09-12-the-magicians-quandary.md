I am more than a magician. Well, more than what the commoner would call a magician. I am not wearing a pointed hat with stars and the moon adorning it. There is no cape upon my shoulders, it would be so Sherlockian of me, but it just doesn't look good on me. No wand resting easily in my hand as I draw with light in the night skies. It isn't just that those are the cliches, it's that I look better in my t-shirt and board shorts. Instead of pointed felt shoes that lace up to my calf, I wear flip-flops. All of those things aside, I am a wizard. A shaman. A sorcerer of sorts. I speak to the unseen energies that ebb and flow over the lands. I commune with the divinity in the bodies of water, wherever they may be. I share my food with the faeries and other beings of the woods. I guess I'm not sure what you would call me.
