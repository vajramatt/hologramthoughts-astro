Ok, enough of this messing around... I am going to commit myself to a Chenrezig practice in full. Mantra, meditation, comtemplation, compassion, adoration, and hopefully; understanding will emerge.

Om Mani Padme Hung...

It is beautiful to listen to. Beautiful to say. I have a little sing-song way of doing it that I first heard from a Lama who was visiting Oklahoma City in 2007. Well, I think it was 2007. Could have been 2006 I guess.

Lord Chenrezig is the Buddha of Compassion, and I need him in my life.
