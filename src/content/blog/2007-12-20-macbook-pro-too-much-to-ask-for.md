![MacBook Pro](https://www.hologramthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/product-15in-macbook1.jpg)I was talking to a friend about something I want last night. It is a large expense and one I would not normally lavish upon myself when I can so easily think of other things I need to spend my money on first. A fence for the backyard, a new car for my mother-in-law, an [iMac](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Desktop-Display-MA878LL-SuperDrive%2Fdp%2FB000R805L4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1198178616%26sr%3D1-3&tag=hologramthoug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) for the family, things the kids need and so on and so forth... But I really want a MacBook Pro. There, I said it: I want a [MacBook Pro](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MacBook-MA895LL-Notebook-SuperDrive%2Fdp%2FB000R7X80U%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1198178414%26sr%3D8-7&tag=hologramthoug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325). How would I use this laptop? Umm, I would blog on it, I would be the bestest photo guy, always updating my Picasa, I would write my books that would make millions and then I would do homework with the kids on it in their rooms. I am pretty sure the laptop would help me become enlightened too... I really think so. I could learn all about the Buddha and his teachings, I would study and then even write some sites devoted to offering those same teachings to others. I know, I know; this all sounds very precocious and trite: but let's look at some other items that would be great while we are on this subject. I could handle an iPhone, and [iPod](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-16-GB-iPod-touch%2Fdp%2FB000JNYWBG%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1198179625%26sr%3D1-1&tag=hologramthoug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)Touch. (I don't think I really need the iPod if I get the iPhone, but might as well put it out there right?) I have a great little pocket camera already, but I need a sweet [DSLR](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-40D-10-1MP-Digital-Camera%2Fdp%2FB000V5P90K%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1198180031%26sr%3D1-11&tag=hologramthoug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) to get some action pics of my kids and their sports... I know I will feel guilty about this as soon as I post it; but there it is.
