Mind itself, \

Has no support, has no object:

Let it rest in its natural expanse without any fabrication.

When the bonds \ are released,

You will be free, there is no doubt.

As when gazing into space,

All other visual objects disappear,

So it is for mind itself.

When mind is looking at mind,

All discursive thoughts cease

And enlightenment is attained.

As in the sky all clouds

Disappear into sky itself:

Wherever they go, they go nowhere.

This is the same for thoughts in the mind:

When mind looks at mind,

The waves of conceptual thought disappear.

As empty space

Is devoid of form, colour or image,

So too, mind itself

Is free of form, colour or image.

As the heart of the sun

Cannot be veiled by an eternity of darkness

So too, the realization of the ultimate nature of the mind

Cannot by veiled by an eternity of samsara.

Even though empty space

May be named or conventionally defined,

It is impossible to point it out as “this”.

It is the same for the clarity of mind itself:

Although its characteristics may be expressed,

It cannot be pointed out as “this”.

The defining characteristic of mind

Is to be primordially like empty space;

The realization of the nature of the mind

Includes all phenomena without exception.

Abandoning all bodily activities,

Remain like a bunch of straw cut loose,

Abandoning all verbal expressions of speech,

Remain like a lute with its strings cut through.

Abandoning all mental activity,

That is Mahamudra.

In the dharma tradition of this old lady

There is nothing to do other than this.

Ah, fortunate heirs and disciples gathered here,

This body of ours is impermanent like a feather on a high mountain path,

This mind of ours is empty and clear like the depth of space,

Relax in that natural state, free of fabrication.

When mind is without any support, that is Mahamudra.

Becoming familiar with this, blend you mind with it -

That is Buddhahood.

Right now you have the opportunity.

Look for the essence of mind - this is meaningful.

When you look at mind, there’s nothing to be seen.

In this very not seeing, you see the definitive meaning.

This old lady has no instructions more profound to give you.
