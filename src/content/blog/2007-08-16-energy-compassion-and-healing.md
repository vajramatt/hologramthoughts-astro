I went last night to the [Oklahoma City Reiki Energy Circle Meetup](http://reiki.meetup.com/269/). Very nice group of people there. The woman who runs the Meetup has been practicing for 4 or 5 years, I forget how long, and is very knowledgeable. There is one person there that kinda blows me away. His name is Jim and his knowledge of the healing arts is formidable, for sure. [Healing Touch](http://www.healingtouchinternational.org/) and [Qigong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong) seem to be his area of expertise and he knows how to communicate with the person he is treating to help them as best he can. I was skeptical when I first began to talk to people about Reiki. But being in the martial arts has probably predisposed me to accepting the idea of chi. Call is chi, ki, prana, or whatever; different cultures refer to the life energy in different ways, but it's all the same. A good friend of mine, [Gardner Singleton](http://www.easthealingarts.com/), is a acupuncturist and Chinese herbal doctor. Learning from him has taught me to open myself up and experience what other cultures can teach me on the healing front. Herbs are used world wide by the indigenous cultures. From China to Australia to the Native American culture they are seen as the natural way to cure what ails us. It just so happens that these same cultures are not only open to the idea of chi, but all of them openly practice the energy work and training in various methods. OK, back to Reiki then. Last night during the session I was flush with heat. The feeling of pin pricks was so strong on my hands that I had to shake them out more than a few times. It was amazing. Then, at the end, to see the woman we worked on and how she reacted to the healing; that was wonderful. One of the women there, who is also an energy worker and yogini, asked me if I was using intention while working with the patient. I told her that I have been practicing [tonglen](http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/pema/tonglen1.php) while doing my Reiki. Tonglen is a Tibetan Buddhist practice of taking and sending. You are actively taking the pain and suffering from someone and sending them compassion. When you inhale you remove from them the suffering and when you exhale you send them pure compassion. I can't think of a better thing to offer someone; the wish that they are relieved of their suffering and that you are giving them compassion.
