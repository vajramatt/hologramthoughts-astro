I am not happy with our society and the values that it seems to promote.  Everyday I read about new military efforts around the world, and of course, new 'terrorist' action.  (By the way, when I say 'terrorist', if you hear 'CIA', I understand.)  I keep thinking about the amount of money the US spend on this war on terror, and how it would be better spent feeding the hungry, giving homes to the homeless, healing the sick... hell, almost anything would be a better use of these billions.

I hear that we don't have the money to put computers on the desk in my local school. Really? How about we don't build one F-22 Raptor jet?  The F-22 costs **$137.5 million**. Let's say instead we buy some decent $800 Apple laptops for the kids at school.  That would be around 171, 875 laptops bought for that one F-22.  I think that is a really good deal.  Close to 172,000 kids would have a computer on their school desk... Seriously, that is amazing.

Look, I understand the hawks out there saying we need to have a well trained military, I am a proud Marine, but the spending is ludicrous to say the least.  And, I hate the argument that I hear from people that goes something like this, "spend whatever it takes to protect the lives of our young military men and women." Umm, how about this for protecting their lives: keep them home, don't send them to some forsaken desert to die at the hands of people who have been brainwashed into hating them by the ruling elite for the last 2000 years.

You don't really think these wars are anything new do you?  Every empire needs an enemy, even more so than it needs allies.

I say we start the change now, today.  Stop wasting money and start healing the world instead. Can you even imagine how much the savings would be if we shut down a carrier group?  Imagine the money taken from 3,200 warships, all the sailors and Marines, all the land-based support personnel and all of the weaponry; and instead used to heal, clothe, feed and educate.

Don't whine about all of those jobs being lost. Don't. Instead think of all of that energy being diverted to growing food, teaching children, healing the sick, and more.  Actually, think about using that immense amount of energy to heal the sick *before* they are sick.

I mean it.

Teach meditation to the masses.  Offer free yoga and t'ai chi in every park in America.  Feed people clean food.  If it has an ingredients list on it, then trash it.  Vegetables don't need ingredients, fruit, whole grains and meat don't need the ingredients list either.  If you feed people real food, raised in an organically authentic way, then we won't need to see our doctors every other week.

I sit in meditation every day, and I clear my mind of the garbage that it accumulates, seeking a clear vision of the me, or what ever that means.  I do this so that I can see the reality around me. So that I can understand what is moving around me.  This world could live in a state of compassion forever, if only we would try.

Try with me?
