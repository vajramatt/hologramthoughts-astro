A few nights ago I stood on the back porch, watching these amazing clouds roll in from the west. They formed a line that existed in the heavens alone, but for a moments they divided the heavens above my backyard. My backyard was the battleground in a multi-front war fought between leprechauns and dragons, cats, forest creatures, Russians, unicorns, and midgets. I watched as the dragons flew, with leprechaun riders on their back, throwing fire and acid onto the armor wearing cats and their allies, the midgets. Attacking the Russians before they could reinforce the leprechauns were the unicorns. Their horns bathed in the vodka soaked blood of the Russians, the unicorns charged into battle with the battle cry that sounds exactly like a 1980s arena hair band at full throttle. It was glorious. I sincerely hope that the midgets and the cats took out as many as they could... Midgets in sombreros. Cats in armor.
