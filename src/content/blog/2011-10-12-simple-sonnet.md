I said I would give you a sonnet, I made no promise it would be worthy...   Is there a reason to imagine this light in the sky, Is there doubt, look into the darkness, Is there a sound that can be made to take you away from me, Is there a place where we cannot be? Winter leaves holding tight to bare limbs, Dimming skies filled with despair, She sits against the cold stone waiting, The sounds of the night upon her now. Nothing inside of him to hold on to, Nowhere to grasp, No one to cling to, He tramps on into the night, searching. His hand in hers, his heart beating still, Her lips brush against his temple, Heaven.
