I went to my first official Buddhist function this past weekend in Oklahoma City. A local Kagyu meditation group brought (http://www.ktcdallas.org/lamala/lama.htm), pictured at right, to speak on the subject of (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo), the intermediate state.

We are all in Bardo right now.  Every moment of every day we are in a state of transition.  From waking to sleep, from birth to death, from one mood to another; transition.  Lama spoke about the bardo of dreams, of meditation and obviously the state of bardo after death, before rebirth.

For those enlightened or advanced enough on the Dharma path, bardo can be a time of liberation and knowledge; a time to further advance before rebirth.  For the rest of us though, we suffer the chance that bardo is filled with hallucinatory images related to our own needs and desires; virtually ensuring that we are born into a lower realm.

I am reading more about the subject in a book, which is just good timing, I didn't plan this.  The book is (http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=The%20Tibetan%20Yogas%20of%20Dream%20and%20Sleep&tag=hologramthoug-20&index=blended&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325) by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, a lama in the Bon tradition.  I plan on moving to this one as soon as I feel ready for it, (http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hologramthoug-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=9627341118&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr), by Chokyi N. Rinpoche.

The most famous book on the subject of Bardo is Bardo Thodol, *Liberation through Hearing in the Intermediate State,* which in the west we have mistakenly named (http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Tibetan%20Book%20of%20the%20Dead&tag=hologramthoug-20&index=books&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325).  I actually have a really cool version of this on video, Lenoard Cohen narrates the video.

Okay, how was that for rambling?

The talk was held at (http://www.windsongdojo.com/), a wonderful Aikido & Judo dojo here in Oklahoma City.
