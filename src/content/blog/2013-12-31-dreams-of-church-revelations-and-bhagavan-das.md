My wife and I woke this morning and while laying in bed we started to talk about our dreams, nothing unusual there. I told her about my dream of being back at Our Lady of Fatima church, where we met and grew up, and that I was told by several older parishioners that I no longer belonged there. She looked at me and said how strange that was because she had also dreamed of Our Lady's. She was attending a parish dinner but she could not find a seat. Soon she realized that she no longer belonged there and she left on her own and walked back to her family home. So, we both dreamed about Our Lady's and about leaving it behind. I was basically questioned and then asked to leave by the Church Council in my dream, and my wife simply felt out of place being there in her dream. Neither dream was confrontational, in fact my dream was touching in many ways. In the dream I was just getting to mass when a gentleman who is now deceased asked if we could speak for a moment. He and I stepped to the side of a large hallway and we chatted about my beliefs. An older woman asked what I believed about Roman Catholicism and I repeated the dogma of my youth until she waved her hand dismissively. The gentleman then lightly grabbed my arm, turned it a bit to show the large Om symbol tattoo and said that it was alright, that it was time that I moved on. I started to wonder about our dreams in the shower and then again on the drive to the office, we car pool every day... Last night when we got home there was a box waiting for me from a friend that I met online. My friend had asked on Facebook if anyone wanted some malas and other assorted items that had been left in his possession by [Bhagavan Das](http://www.bhagavandas.com), an American sadhu and kirtan singer. I had mentioned that I would enjoy working with them and he shipped them to me soon after. The box contained many malas, mala beads, some small pendents, a tiny figurine of Nandi, Shiva's mount, and a book about the Divine Mother with Durga on the cover. Bhagavan Das was the first western student of Neem Karoli Baba, who was also the guru of Ram Dass and Krishna Das.  Not long ago I watched a documentary about Bhagavan Das and while I have no illusions to him being a modern day saint, I do feel that there is energy and karma associated with him. Perhaps it was that energy that spoke to my wife and I last night. Perhaps the Divine Mother let me wife and I know that it was alright to let go of our childhood and move into our own spirituality now. Perhaps.
