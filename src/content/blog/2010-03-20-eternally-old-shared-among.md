To look into the blue diamond
to wander through the fields of gold
to smile at the moon and see her smile back

To listen to the birds of paradise
to speak with the wind
to wash away your sins in the streams of tears

To accept the sun upon your neck
-- golden skin and sweat stained cotton
to see the life within the dirt at your feet

Questioning your thoughts
each one new and unique in this moment
each one eternally old, shared among the stars
