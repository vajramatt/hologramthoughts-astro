There are times in life when you simply are at a loss. Moments when nothing seems to make sense, when nothing you have known is what you thought, when nothing you had planned is as it seems, when the world is helter-skelter and you are wondering at the nature of reality.  I guess we all have these times in life,what matters to me is how we handle them.  How often do we step back, re-evaluate the situation, and then find the right outcome for who we are.  Not who we were, not who we want to become, but who we are, now.

Who are you right now?
