A few days ago I left my house, driving to work, and the world was full of bright sunshine and blue skies. Before I had driven a mile I was looking at a solid gray sky with fast moving, white wispy clouds, racing along beneath the gray. It was just starting to sprinkle and the smell in the air was clean and fresh, rains were sweeping towards me, I could see it coming in the distance.

My attention was caught by a massive rainbow showing over a small elementary school. The colors were deep and rich, they did not seem to be transparent like other rainbows, but instead they seems to be solid. If I could find the site there this rainbow was touching ground I know I could have climbed it, it would have held weight.

Children from the school stood in the last rays of the sunshine, pointing up to the rainbow to show their friends. A hundred small arms stretched up, pointing to the heavens, showing the way. It was majestic and wonderful, pure everyday magic; this solid rainbow for all to see.

The contrast in colors: the rainbow, superimposed on the gray rain clouds, was moving and beautiful; a spiritual experience for everyone to see.
