A while back I read some articles on the Four Reminders and they made a lot of sense to me. They are the a way to think about ourselves and our place in the universe. A way to make some sense of it all and a way to keep the Dharma in mind.

1.  This chance is precious.
2.  We will all die.
3.  Samsara - suffering is everywhere.
4.  Karma is the law of the universe.

This is very foreign to many of us in the west, but also has a resonance about it. It just sounds familiar and right. I have nothing deep to depart with you today, just this small message that the 4 Reminders has for us. If you wish to learn more about the 4 Reminders, and I hope you do, please visit this link to read [meditations written by Ven. Lama Norlha Rinpoche](http://www.simhas.org/teaching8.html). On a side note I found a small list of parenting and children's books on the subject of the Buddha, the Dharma and other Buddhist related topics, I added a few more and so now I want to share this with you. Books about parenting with Compassion:
