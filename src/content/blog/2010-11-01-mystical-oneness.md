You take two particles, maybe even just two atoms and you 'entangle' them by linking them on an almost esoteric level. Imagine now that these two particles can be used as a faster-than-light communications system.  Move the particle here on Earth in a series of movements, and instaneously the entangled particle does the same, no matter where it sits.  A continent away, a planet away, across the universe, the entanglement would allow for a communications device that would span any distance.  Modern science calls it 'quantum entanglement'.

I allowed myself to do some dream thinking and I was struck with an idea, if the Big Bang theory is accurate, then once upon a time all particle were entangled at the core, because all mass was touching before the big bang. In that timeless moment, no matter how 'long' it lasted, all mass was in effect, the same particle. Once the expansion began, mass separated, but still, the connection once established would still be active. Right?

This is where I wondered if this is where *déjà vu* perhaps come from.  Maybe this is where those fleeting moments of prescience comes from when a mother knows her child is sick, even though they are miles apart.  Is this where that feeling comes from when you think of someone just as they are calling you on the phone? So many coincedences... Oh, I do not accept coincedence.

Shamans from around the world know how to enter an other-worldly state where they claim to be in communion with all space-time, are they really just remembering that oneness that the particles of thier body once knew?

Perhaps the spooky action is really an infentisemal wormhole? Imagine for a moment a reality where you could actually walk through space-time, from one 'place' to another, especially knowing that the 'place' itself is a fallicy.

The mind boggles...

P.S. My good friend (http://www.wonderlane.com) sent this link to me: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe) and it resonates with me!
