In Buddhism these eight symbols of good fortune represent the offerings made by the gods to Shakyamuni Buddha immediately after he attained enlightenment.

Designs of the Eight Auspicious Symbols decorate all manner of sacred and secular Buddhist objects. One finds them embellishing wooden furniture, metalwork, carpets, silk brocades, jewelry, paper, and as wall hangings in temples.

**Endless Knot** - symbolizes the nature of reality where everything is interrelated and only exists as part of a web of karma and its effect. Having no beginning or end, it also represents the infinite wisdom of the Buddha, and the union of compassion and wisdom. Also, it represents the illusory character of time, and long life as it is endless.

**Dharma Wheel** - symbolizes the auspiciousness of the turning of the precious wheel of Buddha's doctrine, both in its teachings and realizations, in all realms and at all times, enabling beings to experience the joy of wholesome deeds and liberation. The eight spokes refer to the Noble Eightfold Path, one of the Buddha's first teachings.

**Lotus Flower** - symbolizes the complete purification of the defilements of the body, speech and mind, and the full blossoming of wholesome deeds in blissful liberation.

**The Victory Banner** - represents the victory of the Buddha's teachings over death, ignorance, disharmony and all the negativities of this world. It also symbolizes the victory of Buddhist doctrine over all harmful and pernicious forces.

**Treasure Vase** - The Treasure Vase symbolizes an endless rain of long life, wealth and prosperity and all the benefits of this world and liberation. Also known as the "vase of inexhaustible treasures, it is a sign of the inexhaustible riches available in the Buddhist teachings.

**Golden Fishes** - signify fearlessness and happiness as they swim freely through the oceans without drowning, freely and spontaneously, just as fish swim freely without fear through the water. The fishes symbolize happiness, for they have complete freedom in the water.

**Precious Parasol** - symbolizes the beneficial activities of keeping beings from the harms of illness, harmful forces, obstacles and so forth. It also represents the enjoyment of a feast of benefit under its cool shade.

**Right-Coiled White Conch** - represents the beautiful sound of the spread of the Buddhadharma. Its sound is deep, far-reaching and melodious, and hearing it awakens beings from the deep slumber of ignorance, urging them to accomplish their own and others' welfare.
