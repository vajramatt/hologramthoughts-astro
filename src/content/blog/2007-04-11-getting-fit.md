I am going to get in to shape again; mentally, physically and spiritually too.

This is my plan:

Step 1: Sculpt my body.

For some reason I let my body go as my job and home life became more hectic.  When I began my career I left my physique at the doorway... dumb.  So I am going to make a concerted effort to work this tired, fat, old body now before I no longer can.  The gym, judo and yoga should be just what I need.  The body is your temple, right?

I will go back to judo again.

Step 2: Learn again.

About the same time I was letting my body go I was learning a lot of new and wonderful information about technology and business.  But then that slowed too over the years.  Now I have almost zero desire to read a book about my career unless I actually need to.  So I am going to learn about what I do enjoy: history, religion, and science.

Step 3: Become Spiritual.

I have been religious my entire life.  Attended church every Sunday, went to religious education as a child, I even went to a parochial school until sixth grade; but that doesn't make you spiritual.  I knew the history of the bible and I am able to carry on a detailed conversation about the bible and Christianity, but I don't know that I was spiritual.

I have been more spiritual since I began to learn about The Buddha than ever before... it just seems tangible to me.  Funny, I use the word 'tangible' when I am talking about spirituality.
