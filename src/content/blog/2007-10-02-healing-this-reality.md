This one may be too squishy and goody-goody for some of you. It might sound too 'out there' and too 'new age' for most of us stoic westerners, but it resonates with me and I hope you can find a little peace in it too.

So, tell me, what do you think about it. Can we heal the planet with our thoughts and intentions? Can we heal each other with good and positive thoughts? Is it possible to sit quietly each morning and pray or meditate the world to peace? I think so.

Over a decade ago an experiment to reduce crime in Washington D. C. was shown to have an effect. A large group of people utilized (http://www.tm.org/)(TM) to increase coherence and decrease stress within the District. The benefits were shown to be excellent.

For a very detailed report on the meditation experiment please visit this site at the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy: (http://www.istpp.org/crime_prevention/)

Imagine a world where we were all conscious of our own thoughts. Where we used our thoughts, our intentions, to heal the world, to heal our families, friends and every person alive in the past, present and future.

It would be amazing.

I have decided that I can be a healer too, just as you can as well. I am learning to use Reiki to heal and I have already experienced some wonderful effects. What can you do to heal yourself and the world around you?

The Buddha said this: "Our sorrows and wounds are healed only when we touch them with compassion."

So go now and show compassion to everyone and everything, begin the healing.
