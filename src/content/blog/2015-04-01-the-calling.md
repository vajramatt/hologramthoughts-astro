!(https://res.cloudinary.com/hologram-thoughts/image/upload/h_300,w_298/v1438748900/owl_with_stars_hlcqae.jpg)Call the good ancestors whom have wished us well down throughout the eons.

Call the Mother spirit of the earth upon whom we stand and from whom all nourishment comes.

Call upon the spirit of the air from who we fill out belly with power and voice.

Call upon the spirit of the sun whom warms our skin and sends down all energy to Gaia for us.

Call upon the spirit of the water without which all would wither and fail.

Call upon the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, from whom compassion originates.

Call upon those beings who wish to help us. The local protectors, the spirits of the woods and plants, the energies that swirl the flower petals around us, that draw the dragonflies to us, that watch over us through the eyes of owls and bears.

Call upon the shaman already in your own essence.
