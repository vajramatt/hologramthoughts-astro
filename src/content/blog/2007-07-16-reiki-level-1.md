This past Saturday I began my path to Reiki healer.  I met with a Reiki master and after a few hours I asked for and received the attunement for Reiki I.  Way too much for me to go in to here, but follow this link for a good explanation: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiki#First_degree)

It is a couple of days now, since my attunement, and I am practicing at night, but after my first 30 days I will know more.  Hopefully I will be able to use it and provide some healing.

I was drawn to Reiki due in large part to my participation in the martial arts.  I have practiced the martial side of a few arts, so now I want to use the healing side of chi.

I strongly feel that all things are connected at the base, gross level.  I feel that we all share the same energy and that that energy pervades all places, people and things.  Plants, animals and landscapes are alive with that same energy, we have forgotten this for some reason.  It is time to remember.

Buddhist, Christian, Hindu or Native American mystic — they all knew the same thing: we are all connected.

More later,

Matt
