How do I express this in words when words fail me?

Sanātana Dharma,The Eternal Law, has become a part of me like not even my Christianity did, and I was raised as a Roman Catholic from the cradle until I was about 34 years old. Since then I have read about Dharma, listened to countless podcasts about Dharma, spoken with those who practice Dharma, and watched many documentaries about Dharma.

At any one time I probably have four or five books about various Dharmic subjects around the house in various stages of completion that I am reading. It kind of drives my wife crazy. Of course, she is alright with my assertion that she is my Goddess as she is the living incarnation of Devi in our relationship.

 

Only recently have my eyes and heart been opened to the amazing deity known as Hanuman. While I won't go in to great detail about who he is as there are many qualified sources for that information, I will say that he is genuinely spectacular.

***
Om Hum Hanumate Namah***

His simple mantra brings a feeling of warrior strength and compassionate determination to my heart.

His yantra pulls me in as I chant the mantra over and over. It is a hypnotic state like which I have not experienced before.

This is a decent example of his mantra that I have used from YouTube.
