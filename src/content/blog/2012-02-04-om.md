OM

The imperishable sound,

is the seed of all that exists.

The past, present, the future,

all are but the unfolding of OM.

And whatever transcends the three realms of time,

that indeed is the flowering of OM.

This pure self and OM are as one,

and the different quarters of the self

correspond to OM and its sounds.

 

--Mandukya Upanishad
