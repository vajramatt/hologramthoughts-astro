Prayer of Refuge and Bodhicitta

I take refuge until I am enlightened
In the Buddhas, the Dharma and the Sangha.

Through the merit I create by practicing giving and the other perfections.

May I attain Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings.

   The Four Immeasurable Thoughts

May all sentient beings have happiness and the causes of happiness;

May all sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering;

May all sentient beings never be separated from the happiness that knows no suffering;

May all sentient beings live in equanimity, free from attachment and aversion.
