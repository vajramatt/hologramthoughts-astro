A blooming flower is more worthy of our gaze than all the stars in the sky.

Dig your bare feet into the earth. Feel the grass and dirt merge with your soul, there is no distinction between you and it. There is no other.

I know that you'll find love if you allow it into your heart.

I am your advocate.
