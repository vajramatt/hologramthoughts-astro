Anne Korin gave a talk about the Oil issues that America is facing today.  The [original post](http://news.muckety.com/2008/08/06/anne-korin’s-profile-is-rising-with-the-price-of-crude-oil/4442 "Anne Korin article at Muckety") is at Muckety, but I wanted to repost it in hopes that more eyes see it. Check out this quote:

> “The fact that we are conservative does not equal allegiance to one political party. Blind allegiance to any political party, in my view, is never good. Conservative means allegiance to a set of principles and you have to look and see… If people are not representing these principles they do not deserce the support of the conservative movement. It’s that simple. And this is a much bigger discussion than the oil issue.”

This is a quick list of statistics from Anne Korin’s speech

*   The U.S. has about 3% of the world’s conventional oil reserves
*   The U.S. accounts for about 25% of the world’s oil demand
*   During the oil embargo on the 1970’s the U.S. imported about 30% of its oil
*   Today we import over 60% of our oil and the number continues to grow
*   The transportation sector is 98% petroleum dependent
*   66% of our oil consumption is in the transportation sector
*   2% of our electricity generation comes from oil
*   35 years ago the countries of OPEC produced 30 million barrels of oil per day
*   Today the countries of OPEC produce 32 million barrels of oil per day
*   In the same 35 years non OPEC production of oil has doubled
*   OPEC countries have 75% of the world’s oil reserves
*   The global oil market is currently about 85 million barrels of oil per day
*   Flex fuel vehicles can run on any combination of gasoline, ethanol or methanol
*   90% of cars sold in Brazil in 2008 are flex fuel vehicles
*   The U.S. produces its ethanol from corn
*   Brazil produces its ethanol from sugar cane
*   It is much cheaper and more efficient to produce ethanol from sugar can than from corn
*   There are 100 countries in the world with a suitable climate for producing sugar cane
*   All cars that General Motors will sell in Brazil in 2008 will be flex fuel vehicles
*   There is no tariff on imported oil in the U.S.
*   There is a 54 cent per gallon tariff on imported ethanol in the U.S.
*   It cost an automaker $100 more to make a flex fuel vehicle than one that runs only on gas
*   17 million cars are sold in the U.S. each year
*   The average lifespan of a vehicle in the U.S. is about 17 years

You can watch this talk in these 7 videos posted at YouTube,  I wonder how long they will be available?

**Korin concluded her speech with this:**

> “We talked about some things we can do. We have a responsibility to make them happen. These are very straight forward non-interventionist policies. Requiring new cars to be flex fuel vehicles. Repeal the tariff on ethanol imports. And if we want to encourage more rapid commercialization of plug-in hybrids…a consumer tax credit…to drop the cost for early adopters and push this technology into the market quicker. If we do this we change the situation. If we don’t do this we are all responsible for the diminishment of this country and our inability to prevail in the long war of the 21st century.”
