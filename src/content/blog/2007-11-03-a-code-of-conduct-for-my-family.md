This is a list of thoughts, actions and ways.  It is written to help you, and all of us to be kinder, more compassionate people.  I believe that our job in this life is to show compassion, understanding and to ease suffering wherever we find it.

	

- Respect all beings: your parents, grandparents, siblings, elders and everyone you meet deserves your respect.  This includes all living beings too.  Dogs, cats, all animals, insects and plants.

	

- Treat others the way you want to be treated - this is the Golden Rule of life.

	

- Be courteous and polite, help rather than hinder.  Raising your voice is not necessary nor does it get you what you seek.

	

- Listen to what other people have to say, don't interrupt when others are talking for you can not learn from your own voice. Patience is a virtue that should be cultivated and encouraged.

	

- Do not make fun of others or call them names.  This would hurt your feelings if someone did this to you.

	

- Do not bully or pick on others.  Instead, protect those who cannot do so for themselves.  It is easy to be a bully; it takes courage to be a protector.

	

- Turn away from pride.  Have the strength to admit when you are wrong and the intelligence to learn from others.

	

- Anger is never quelled by anger, but only by love.

This is written for my children, but I will strive to live by these rules myself.
