First: I had a wonderful talk with Loppön Barbara Du Bois yesterday, she is a blessing. We talked about everything and nothing. (Sorry, Buddhist joke.) We talked about the similarities between Roman Catholic Christianity and Tibetan Buddhism, we talked about daily practice, compassion and bodhicitta and the idea of a Bodhisattva. You know that feeling you get when you slide down into a steaming bath? The one where your entire body relaxes. You realize that your forehead, your shoulders, your muscles and even your skin was pulled tight with stress; and then you let go and relax and let the hot water work on you. That was the feeling I experienced when she told me we would be talking again. I will be speaking to her often I hope. She is affiliated with the [Garchen Buddhist Institute](http://www.garchen.net/teachers.html) in Arizona. I hope to visit it one day. [Dana Abbott](http://www.samuraisports.com/about/abbottbio.html) told me that the area is beautiful. Who knows, maybe I can fly out and bum transportation and quarters from him or my cousins that live in the desert? Second: I am going to help a good friend of mine, [Gardner](http://www.easthealingarts.com/), plan a weekend of Dharma talks that we hope to have in place for next spring. Either his guru will come to Oklahoma City for those, or someone that is recommended to him. Gardner is in the Karma Kagyu lineage and I am learning about that lineage from him and now from Loppön Du Bois as well. Seems coy but the term 'karma' might be apt here. That reminds me to talk to another good friend, Kris. She is a member of [Rissho Kosei Kai](http://www.ibc-rk.org/) here in Oklahoma City. Kris helps run the local [Dharma Center](http://www.rkok-dharmacenter.org/). Kris is one of my touchstones here in OKC. She is a counselor and friend, someone I know I can turn to for answers to questions and general support. I need to see what thoughts Kris has about RKK helping Gardner and I bring out a Lama to do a Dharma talk. And lastly for today: One thing that Loppön Du Bois mentioned is that I read too much with out doing the practice. She is right, so I am going to let the books gather some dust while I begin to practice more openly, more consciously and with more resolve. I want to take a moment and thank Gardner, Kris, my friend Linda and now Loppön Du Bois for their kind words and counsel, for their love and compassion and for their time. They mean more than they know.
