Today I watched Dr. Wayne Dyer's PBS presentation called The Power of Intention with my family.  My mother-in-law wrote down the "The Dyer Dozen" for reconnecting to Source.  The Source he describes is that which people call God with any name they choose.  His words are in bold below, with my own reflections under them.  He is amazing, and I am no where near as educated or known as him, but hey, this is my blog so I added my thoughts too. :)

**1 ) Want more for others than you want for yourself. **
My comment: If you want peace, seek that peace for others and you will find it for yourself.  If you want happiness, offer that happiness to all of those you meet, and happiness will be yours.  Show compassion to all, and compassion is yours.

**2 ) Think from the end. **
My comment: See the outcome you are seeking as if it has already occurred, and then work backward to actually reach that goal.

**3 ) Be an appreciator in your life.**
My comment: Look for that which is valuable rather than worthless. When you depreciate you take value away, when you appreciate, you add value. Make it a point therefore to always add value, therefore you yourself are more valuable to any situation.

**4 ) Stay in rapport with Source.**
My comment: Strive to continuously be mindful of your link with the Source.  It is within you, and you are within the Source.

**5 ) Understand Resistance from the Source.**
My comment: My understanding of this is best represented by my time in the martial arts.  In judo, the way you learn a throw is by being thrown.

**6 ) Contemplate yourself surrounded by the conditions you want to produce. You are one with Source and can create anything you desire. Source can't be anything other than it is, neither can you.**
My comment: That energy is there, waiting for you to call upon it.  Pray, ask, offer yourself to it.

**7 ) Understand the art of allowing. Taking the path of least resistance. Every thought with resistance in it, creates the path of least allowing. Are you pulling energy from Source or pushing against the Flow?**
My comment: My ears opened up on this one.  I am not a negative person, I offer a smile to people I meet, a kind word, it is just who I am; and this is why.

**8 ) Practice radical humility. You are not the body or mind you are in. You are not the possessions you have, you are the Divine Source. Come home to your real self and realize that you are no better or worse than anyone else.**
My comment: The old saying that you are a spiritual being experiencing a physical world is true.  I see it everyday, even if sometimes I forget it myself.

**9 ) Stay in a constant state of gratitude: stay in a state of being generous and grateful. Rumi said: "Trade your knowldege for bewilderment" Be in constant awe and wonder at the generosity and beauty of life and be grateful for it. **
My comment: Be like the little children, as Christ taught us.

**10 ) Keep in mind that you can never resolve a problem by condemning it. When you use shame, you are using the lowest energy out in the universe. You can't shame your way into the Source just like no amount of poverty you live in can lift anyone else up out of poverty. Be the example you wish to see in the world.
**My comment: Add only positive energy to the world around you. Period. ****

**11 ) Play the match game. Are you matched with the Source?**
My comment: This one is hard...when you realize you are not providing positive energy into any situation, stop yourself.  Re-evaluate who you are, where you are and what you are doing.

**12 ) Meditate: The quiet mind is your way of staying connected to Source. You cannot divide Source/God. Everything else has a polarity/dichotomy except for silence. You cut silence in half and you get more silence. Cut Source in half and you get more Source. You can't divide it. Stay in the Gap.
**My comment: I try to find quiet time to *stop* thinking every day.  When I first began meditating my mind was like a dog on hot pavement, only seeking to be elsewhere.  Now, I find it easier to slip into the special place where I feel most like myself. **
