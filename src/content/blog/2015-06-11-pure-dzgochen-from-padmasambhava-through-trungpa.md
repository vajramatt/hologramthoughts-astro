"The spiritual force of Padmasambhava as expressed in his manifestation as Dorje Trollo is a direct message that no longer knows any question. It just happens. There is no room for making a home out of this. There is just spiritual energy going on that is real dynamite. If you distort it, you are destroyed on the spot. If you are actually able to see it, then you are right there with it. It is ruthless. At the same time, it is compassionate, because it has all this energy in it. The pride of being in the state of crazy wisdom is tremendous. But there is a loving quality to it as well. Can you imagine being hit by love and hate at the same time? In crazy wisdom, we are hit with compassion and wisdom at the same time, without a chance of analyzing them. There's no time to think, there's no time to work things out at all. It is there – but at the same time, it isn't there. And at the same time, also, it is a big joke"

Quote from CRAZY WISDOM by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche
