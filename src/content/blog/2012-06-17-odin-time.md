Time moves differently for a god, or sometimes, not at all. Standing among the mountain tops, high in the northern peaks of Asgard, the clouds and rolling thunder bowed down to the All Father. A lone crow perched nearby in a snowy tree cawed to Odin, questioning his thoughts. "I hear you, brother crow." Odin looked to the east, waiting for the sun to break free from his earthly grave, giving dawn to the new day. Far to the south the warriors of Asgard readied their weapons, knowing that war was about to wash over them once again. This time it promised to be the last for generations to come.
