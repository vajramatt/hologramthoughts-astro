We are all connected in surprising ways.  There are times when a simple smile can change someones day, perhaps their life.  We need to remember that somehow.  Just yesterday I was at the a hospital, visiting my grandfather, I was leaning in an elevator, eyes closed, barely breathing - my body tight with worry.  The elevator doors open on a floor before my destination and in walks a slight little woman.  She was close to her 70s if I had to guess, and she was holding a small bag.  She smiled at me, and I returned the smile without thinking.  (I do that a lot actually, someone smiles and I smile back, someone winks and I wink back, not rational - but true.)

In that smile she must have seen that I was worried and so she reached out and her tiny hand clasped my forearm.  I looked down at her hand on my arm and it was a study in contrast.  My arm is thick and strong, I am not a small man, my skin has a Mediterranean tint to it, my hair dark.  Her hand was whiter than normal, the kind of white skin that the elderly get - thin skin and liver spots; but her grasp was strong and true.

"Everything will be alright son," she said without sounding condescending.  I somehow knew she wasn't talking about what my grandfather is going through, or the trials I face in life; somehow I heard her tell me that all of this will make sense one day.  With that the elevator stopped on the 6th floor and she got off without looking back.

I have been thinking about that little woman this morning.  She had never seen me before, will likely never lay eyes on me again, but she reached out to me nonetheless, and she affected my life in a small way, but a meaningful way.

We are all related, we are all the same energy, we need the same exact things to live.  Food, water, shelter, and a chance to live outside of suffering.  I want you to take a few moments from your life, from your busy day and night, and watch this movie.  It is only about 20 minutes long, but it is worth it.
