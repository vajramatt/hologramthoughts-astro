Upon a throne of gold and jewels the guru sits, his eyes closed in effortless, illuminated meditation. A serene smile spreads across his face and then he opens his eyes to gaze upon you. Within those eyes show all of the stars from all of the universes, and yet you can see yourself there, plainly visible in his being.

With a nod the guru sends you into all of those countless universes and shows you every life ever lived in your mindstream, until you come to the only realization that makes sense.

All of the countless mindstreams appear at once and in unison begin prostrations to the guru. Countless knees striking the floor makes a thunderous sound that echoes into the spheres of all creation.

Wandering saints, monks, nuns and all of the local deities bow down and smile in wonder at your own realization.

With each prostration your mindstreams collapse upon themselves until there is only one left standing now before the guru.

All of these lives, all of the suffering, all of the love, all of the misery, joy, pain, and laughter; all of it was one seamless effort to shape you for this moment. Here, now as you stand before the guru you finally see that you have been sitting here upon this throne for all time, waiting for yourself to arrive.

With one voice all sentient beings chant together, *Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Padme Siddhi Hung*.
