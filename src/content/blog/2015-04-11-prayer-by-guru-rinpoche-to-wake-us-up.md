Pure from grasper and grasping is the radiant and empty divine form. I invoke the guru naturally liberated of desire and attachment. Whatever is heard by the ear, All sounds that are grasped as pleasant and unpleasant, Let them remain in the nature of sound and emptiness, free from thought. Sound-emptiness unblocked is the speech of the Victorious Ones I invoke the sound-emptiness speech of the Buddha. Also whatever arises in the mind, Thoughts of the five afflictive emotions, Do not alter them with thoughts of the future or the past, Let them remain in their own state liberating into Dharmakaya. I invoke the guru of intrinsically liberated awareness. The grasping at objects and appearance as “Outer” is purified. The true nature of the clinging mind as “Inner” is liberated, And recognizing the "Middle”- Luminosity - as one’s own nature, Through the compassion of the Buddhas of the three times, May the minds of all beings like me be freed!" Om Ah Hum Vajra Guru Padma Siddhi Hum! ~Excerpts from "The Prayer of the Three Kayas by Padmasambhava."
