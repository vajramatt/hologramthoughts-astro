There's that moment between breaths, when the rain seems to all but stop and hover in the air, when you realize that you have had entire diatribes in your mind and nothing around you has changed at all.

It's in those occasions of high strangeness when we experience who we actually are for another brief splash in the celestial heavens.

Those moments shear away the veil of reality and give us a glimpse into the mind of the only being.

It's not some god by human definition, but rather a cogent and beautiful sentience that likely pays us no attention and yet we are it in every sense of the idea.

Those moments of almost pure math, fleeting and delicate, should be the norm, if only we'd release and accept.
