I recently found the movie *The Yogis of Tibet*on Stage6. It is a documentary about the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet and her Buddhist and Bon yogis. You can watch the movie in its entirety here: [Yogis Of Tibet](http://stage6.divx.com/Lightyears/video/1585355/Yogis-Of-Tibet). This movie shows video from the Chinese invasion of Tibet while it also speaks about the one million Tibetans killed in that invasion and the years since then. Western countries have largely ignored this brutal holocaust in order to appease the Chinese government and promote trade with the commerce engine we know as China. Tibetan yogis are not the yogis most westerners think of, the Hindu yogis. Hindu yogis are known for producing body-bending feats, but the Tibetan yogis are known rather for their practice of yoga of the mind. In the film one lama comments that the definition of a yogi is someone who trains their mind to be "always at ease, always at peace." Sounds to me that we should all strive for that. I have a hard time imaging a more compassionate practice than being at peace at all times. Stressful jobs, relationships, friendships - all of those would benefit. Just for a moment, concentrate with me. Soften your eyes, relax your forehead, let the stress fall away like so much dust. Feel your breath, maybe for the first time today, maybe for the first time ever; really feel it. Take in a deep breath and with it, breathe in the energy that surrounds you, the energy that pervades the whole universe and feeds you even when you do not know it is there for you. Exhale and push out the suffering you have felt today. Exhale and push out the suffering of all those around you, your family, friends, coworkers, people on the street and all of the beings in the universe. Offer everyone this one quiet moment of peace. Now, while you are momentairly stress-free and if you have any interest in Buddha*dharma*, Tibet, China, world economics or global politics; then please take the time to watch this amazing and beautiful documentary. Let me know what you think too.
