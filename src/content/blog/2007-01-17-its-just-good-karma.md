I have been lazy of late and not writing posts.  Mainly because I have been reading more than living, there is an issue in there somewhere.  Reading more about Dzogchen and Dream Yoga, about Tsa Lung and Garab Dorje - it is all a lot to consume in written form rather that experience.

I found a Bon center in Houston that I would like to attend for a retreat, to see how it feels, and I am also learning about the Nyingma lineage as well.  I have known about the Bon tradition for a while and a good friend and adviser told me to look in to the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism when I asked him about Dzogchen recently.

I just finished watching "(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374546/)" and I really enjoyed it.  The story is of an old monk who lives on a floating temple.  The temple floats on an isolated lake in Korea somewhere.  Picturesque and breath-taking.  Cliché I know, sorry.  Anyways, I liked the story.

Back to the Nyingma thing though.  This 'ancient' lineage was started by (http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nyingma.html)himself when he came to Tibet to teach Buddhism.  You think he meant to found a school of Buddhism?  I doubt it.  I would imagine that he was simply teaching the Buddhism that he had been taught by his masters and hoping that the Dharma would spread and fill the world with understanding, compassion and one day, enlightenment.

Seeking mindfulness, looking for suchness, listening with my heart and seeing with my soul, all of these things I think about.  But do I really try to live that life?

Barely.

Watch the movie.
