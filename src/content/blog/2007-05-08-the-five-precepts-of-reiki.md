I am learning more about [Reiki](http://www.reikialliance.com/eng_whatis.html) and preparing to take classes about this healing art. So far I am loving it and what it stands for. I will be blogging more about it soon.

> Just for today (Kyo dake wa): Don't get angry (Okoru na) Don't worry (Shinpai su na) Be grateful (Kansha shite) Work hard (Gyo wo hage me) Be kind to others (Hito ni shinsetsu ni)

\-- *Mikao Usui O'Sensei* I really like [this page](http://www.threshold.ca/reiki/Usui-Gainen.html) at the Reiki Threshold for a good definition of how you should read the 5 concepts and how you can implement them yourself. O'Sensei was a Buddhist and you can clearly see that reflected in his statement. He wanted his followers to chant this as a prayer, as a manta, thinking about it mindfully. Sitting in gassho, that is with your hands in prayer. Live in the Now as anger and worry are useless, be Grateful, have a Right Livelihood and be Compassionate. Sounds like the Eightfold Path was his model.
