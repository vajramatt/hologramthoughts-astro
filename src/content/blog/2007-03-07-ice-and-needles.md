Something I wrote over a decade ago.

> She walks to water’s edge lowers her weeping head why does she cry, for whom does she care? Does she know his name, call out to him, does she dare waves on the stream and leaves flow by I should be there, listen to her cry. Snow comes down now - lays to the side wind speaks of love, tears break the tide does she know she’s worth so much more does she know for whom she cries for? She’s reaching out to the water’s lip (cold wet) ice and needles grab her back, not ready yet Heaven’s close, silence scares quiet prayer, adoration there has she lived her life right eyes closed tight making wishes, begging saints a voice far off, so faint angels looking for her again her world tilts, starts to spin water so warm and light “Carry me away in soft flight,” no more problems no more fears no more laughter no more tears
