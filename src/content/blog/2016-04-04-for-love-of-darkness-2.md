Let drop the anchor pull in the sails damp the lantern this night is done for me Darkness, wicked lover of lonely souls, caresses me I sleep upon the waves of illusion and do dream Angels of the deep offer me direction and council distance grows without movement time slips on, yet the moon hangs still Darkness calls to me, whispering in my ears She knows my thoughts, and honors them to the last The Sun cannot rise no laughter on the waters now Sirens wail waters stale Afloat on the ocean alone in my bed the last crow has left me Yet Darkness stays instead
