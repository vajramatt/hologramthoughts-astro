Sky like mind, mind like wind, wind like laughter, laughter like heaven. We are all a daydream. I catch moments when the I-ness expands into a wholeness of being. To be in that oneness for always. Imagine what we would accomplish if every human lived in respect and compassion. For just one day, I dare you to use no pronouns. Mantra, prayer, magic... Other was sad that Other was other. We created mountains to climb, rivers to swim, trees to rest under, and fruit to eat. You did this. Namaste. There comes a moment when a realization spreads within your mind, like a wave breaking across a distant beach. I am free. We are what the Whole dreams. We sit around this fire together, talking about the stars in the night sky, thinking about the Whole. This ritual is good. Dreams, and dreams of dreams, this is our reality. There is a world of magic, just out of focus from your sight… Breathe, imagine, accept. I strongly believe in Sanatana Dharma (eternal truth) in its true essence, without the religious and ritualistic trappings. Om Namah Shivaya. Keep this in your heart today; you are the universe at play, so enjoy it all. I look into the night skies and I see your face. I look into my heart and I see the All. Go outside. Put your feet on Mother Earth, feel that energy, look into the skies above and breathe. You are loved by the Wholeness That Is.
