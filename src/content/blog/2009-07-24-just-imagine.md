i watched this video and tears came to my eyes. i am crying.  crying. our world is so screwed up. we dont have the money to teach arts in schools, because we need to build arsenals. we make weapons to destroy, instead of music to heal. we strive to kill, when instead we should strive to give each child a home and comfort. we make food into fuel, when we could feed the poor.  all of this could change. if you want to see children smile, to end suffering, to make war a thing only read about in our history books, then you have to be the first person to say so. others only count when you count yourself. i dont want my son to see war.  i never want my daughters to know the fear that daughters all around the world know when armies approach. my children, your children, all children deserve better. i deserve better. you deserve better.
