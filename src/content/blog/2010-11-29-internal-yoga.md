I spend a lot of time talking about and practing yoga, the traditional asanasa that we all asscoiate with yoga. Slow, methodical movements coupled with mindful breathing and directed non-thought. I love it. But, I also enjoy reading about what I would term 'internal yoga', too. So I thought I would put up a small list of the books I have read, or aim to at one point. That list is here in my Amazon store, it is really easy for me to add them and to comment on them, so I love it. The link it [http://bit.ly/internalYoga](http://bit.ly/internalYoga).
