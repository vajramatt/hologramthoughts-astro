> Humanity is moving in a circle. The progress in mechanical things of the past hundred years has proceeded at the cost of losing many other things which perhaps were much more important for it.

> George Gurdjieff (1873 - 1949)

This statement made by Gurdjieff makes me think of the lost knowledge that humanity now clearly needs. The now occult and esoteric knowledge that we wonder about. How did the Indian yogis pinpoint the chakra system? How did the ancient Chinese wizards (doctors) pinpoint the channels for acupuncture?

What in the hell is Yonaguni Jima and why can modern science not explain it? Hundreds of feet under the ocean off of the coast of Japan sits a megalithic city. I would call it a temple complex if you are asking me.

For instance, did you know that in the ancient texts of India there are clear mentions of flying ships shooting energy weapons? No? Well, there are.

There is an archeological dig at Harrapa in the Jodhpur region where the radiation registered so high on investigators’ gauges that the Indian government cordoned off the region. This is from an area thought to be at least 8,000 years old. At least.

The Mahabharata, the Indian epic tells this story:

> ... (it was) a single projectile
> Charged with all the power of the Universe.
> An incandescent column of smoke and flame
> As bright as the thousand suns
> Rose in all its splendor...
>
> ...it was an unknown weapon,
> An iron thunderbolt,
> A gigantic messenger of death,
> Which reduced to ashes
> The entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas.
>
> ...The corpses were so burned
> As to be unrecognizable.
> The hair and nails fell out;
> Pottery broke without apparent cause,
> And the birds turned white.
>
> After a few hours
> All foodstuffs were infected...
> ....to escape from this fire
> The soldiers threw themselves in streams
> To wash themselves and their equipment.

So, what do you think?
