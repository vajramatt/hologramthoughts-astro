You see Her as she really is. You can't see Her with the physical eye. In Sanskrit, the eye taken as a whole is a feminine noun, the eyeball is masculine, the pupil is feminine, and the retina is masculine. So you see the dual nature of the external universe is mirrored in the physical eye. With the physical eye you can not hope to see anything but duality. But when the curtain is lifted, you see the absolute undifferentiated Reality, Nirakara Tattva. So when you begin with ignorance, unable to distinguish e-y-e from I. Smashan Tara removes your karmas and false personalities so then you can see both you and Her as one."   From [Robert Svoboda's Aghora: At the Left Hand of God](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0914732218/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0914732218&linkCode=as2&tag=hologramthoug-20 "On Amazon").
