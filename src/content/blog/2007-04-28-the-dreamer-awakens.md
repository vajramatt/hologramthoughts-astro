Rusted through and covered with vegetation
Locked into place for a thousand years
Nothing can wake you

Asleep and dreaming of glories gone
The world passes over you – unaware
Time has left you behind

Echoes of explosions and laughter
Sounds from children and soldiers
A tiny hand touches your skin

Thought perceived in the distance
Rolling thunder and rain washes you clean
Burnt orange rust breaks free

Green leaves and dirt fall to the ground
Emotion surges to the top
Laughter and explosions
