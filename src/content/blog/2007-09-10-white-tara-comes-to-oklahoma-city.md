(http://www.ktcdallas.org/lamala/lama.htm) came back to Oklahoma City this past weekend for another Dharma Talk at (http://www.windsongdojo.com/). He mainly spoke about the (http://hologramthoughts.blogspot.com/2007/01/bardo-intermediate-state.html), compassion and understanding. Toward the end of the talk Lama-la said that he has some small gifts for us if we were on the Dharma path. Most of us came forward in a single file line to receive his gifts. Most were given small pendents on a red string. Mine is a small pendent with (http://www.medicinebuddha.org/tara.htm) on one side and what I will assume is her mandala on the other.

I knew a little bit about Tara already, but really only about her emanation as Green Tara, so I decided to do some reading and some meditating on White Tara. I found a great resource about (http://www.iloveulove.com/spirituality/buddhist/21tarahomage.htm) and in reading this page I quickly realized that I want to receive teachings from Lama Dorjee soon about Tara.

Compassion and Understanding struck a chord in me when Lama-la spoke that night. I am drawn to Chenrezig anyway, I suppose it was just who Chenrezig is that drew me to learn more and begin to meditate upon him. I mean, the sum of all the innumerable Buddha's compassion; that is amazing. All the enlightened beings in creation consciously pour their compassion into one being for the good of all sentient beings.

Om Mani Padme Hum

Then to find out that Tara is the emanation of compassion and understanding that shown forth in Chenrezig, that just made sense to me. Lama-la saw right to the heart of me and handed me the prefect gift. A red string with a small pendent hanging from it; White Tara on one side and her mandala in thread on the other. Perfect.

Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha

Thank you Lama-la.
