What would the world be like if Abel had known Aikido?

> Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they  were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
>

> Genesis 4:8

What if it had gone down like this instead:

> Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and tried to hit him atop his head with his gardener's rake .  However, Abel being the first Aikido initiate, slid to his left, completed a beautiful tachi dori; taking the rake into his hands and sending Cain onto his stomach in the grasses.

Where would we be?  How long until another person had tried to kill his brother, or his neighbor, or just some random guy in a field?

Maybe Abel would have walked home behind Cain, holding his brothers weapon in one hand while keeping his other hand on Cain's shoulder as they talked about their problems?  If they could have had that chance to talk it out, to find out why Cain was upset, why he was so jealous with the sweet bounty of the fatted calf that Abel had laid out before Yahweh.

Would they had talked long enough to figure out that Yahweh was only messing with them?  Maybe he was only trying to make Cain mad just to see what would happen?  Perhaps Yahweh thought it would be funny to make the brothers argue.  I wonder if he felt guilty when Cain killed Abel?
