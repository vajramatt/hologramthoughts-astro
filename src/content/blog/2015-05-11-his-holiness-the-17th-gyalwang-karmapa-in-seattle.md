I decided to preserve these images here because my wife and I were just in Seattle two weeks ago and we spent time there in this beautiful monastery, the seat of His Holiness Jigdal Dagchen Sakya Rinpoche. My wife took refuge there under him and I also renewed my vows with him. That the Karmapa visited the very same space and indeed stood in the same place we had been in just two weeks earlier is somehow moving and beautiful to me.   Karmapa Chenno!
