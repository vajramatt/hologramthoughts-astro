I wonder how many CEO's would consider the companies they run as compassionate? How many corporations would be classified as 'right', as in, the Eightfold Path right?

1.  Right View
2.  Right Intention
3.  Right Speech
4.  Right Action
5.  Right Livelihood
6.  Right Effort
7.  Right Mindfulness
8.  Right Concentration.

I won't go in to what the Eightfold Path means, because I am not a teacher and because there are very eloquent commentaries on the net already. (links: [Google](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=eightfold+path), [big view](http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/eightfoldpath.html)) And I like this answer that Za Choeje Rinpoche gave:

> ***Q: What is the Eightfold Path?*** **Rinpoche:** The Eightfold Path is right view, right part, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. The right view is understanding the world and oneself in a realistic way. Right part is positive ideas or notions within our mental state. Right speech is speaking with respectful truth and for the welfare of others. Right action is acting with the respect for life, property, and relationships. Right livelihood is living virtuously and meditatively. Right effort is cultivating positive attitudes in our study, and practice. Right mindfulness is maintaining full awareness of our inner and outer environment. Right concentration is observing an object with full attention. from A Buddhist Library at this [link](http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Za%20Choeje%20Rinpoche/Questions%20and%20Answers/Questions%20&%20Answers%20With%20ZaChoeje%20Rinpoche.htm)

OK, so back to my initial musings about companies and business in general. Looking around at the market place today I am hard pressed to find companies that take a respectful approach to consumers. Maybe that is the reason though, companies today do not see people as a 'person', but rather as numbers, just 'consumers'. I wonder what kind of company Shakyamuni Buddha would start today? Healthcare, nutrition, media maybe, I don't know. But I would invest, and I bet others would too. That is the answer! I got it. We need to invest in companies that practice compassion. I just [Googled](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2007-17%2CGGGL%3Aen&q=Compassionate++Companies&btnG=Search) that and found some companies who do not test on animals, so that is a start. The I saw this book in the search results and read about it at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCompassionate-Capitalism-Corporations-Doing-Integral%2Fdp%2F1564147142&tag=hologramthoug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325): Compassionate Capitalism: How Corporations Can Make Doing Good an Integral Part of Doing Well. How cool is that? Gonna buy it. Enough ranting today, I just think we can do better. Instead of spending $339 million dollars on another F-22 Raptor, maybe we can build a school?
