You were born and loved.  
Your own body wanted you to die when you were only days old.   
Surgery, a white cat, and love saved you. 

At thirteen a tiny bug tried to kill you.   
Pain like fire burning your skin for months.   
You wanted to die this time, but you didn’t.   
Love saved you again. 

Every time sadness crept in Love was there.   
Mom and Dad. Grandma and Grandpa.   
Little brother.   
Little sister.   
Friends.   
Shadow.   
Love saved you again. 

Years pass like shadows at dawn.   
Soul-mate wife, soul-mate children.   
Fears and fantasies.   
Hard times and sadness.   
Love saved you again. 

More time slides past.   
Grandparents begin new journeys and they leave holes in your soul.   
Children grow up.   
Love saved you again. 

This poem will remain undone.   
But  
Love saved you again.
