I know this sounds manical, or at least dramatic, but it is true enough. Energy is simple, it seeks to excape all things in all ways. Energy does not stay bound but it always finding the cracks to leap through. A wizards spell, a poem whispered, a child's cry for mom in the dark of night, a prayer chanted over and over again before the candle; all are energy being released.

Energy can also be used, ushered, driven, and sometimes, sometimes it can even be harnessed until the energy seems to have disappeared.

You are energy.
