I do not normally just offer links to other information sources, but this is so important I want everyone to read it and try to understand it. The world cannot continue in this fashion, we cannot allow our brothers and sisters, no matter if they live in another hemisphere, country, state or neighborhood, to die while we pay our farmers to destroy crops.

> *“If the government cannot lower the cost of living it simply has to leave. If the police and UN troops want to shoot at us, that's OK, because in the end, if we are not killed by bullets, we'll die of hunger.”* **– A demonstrator in Port-au-Prince, Haiti**

In the past few years I have opened my eyes to how this world operates, who operates and how 99.9% of us sit back while a very select few gain more at our expense. Make no mistake, they are people who revel in our suffering. Only by helping those around you can you attain happiness, not by collecting more money, or homes, or cars or whatever... Only by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked can we find an end to suffering.

Another piece of information in this article that should make you pay attention is this:

> In addition, for several decades the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have refused to advance loans to poor countries unless they agree to “Structural Adjustment Programs” (SAP) that require the loan recipients to devalue their currencies, cut taxes, privatize utilities, and reduce or eliminate support programs for farmers.

So that explains it fairly bluntly: wealthy nations force those who are in need to subjugate themselves for the help they are receiving. Clearly, it is not the intent of the World Bank to lift the poorer nations out of poverty, but rather to enslave them.

Anyone remember this quote?

> “**Whatsoever you do to the least** of my people, that **you do** unto me.” (Matthew 25:40)

For a nation that calls itself Christian, America is doing a woeful job. We are truly one people. There is no real distinction between you, me and the starving child in Haiti. None.
