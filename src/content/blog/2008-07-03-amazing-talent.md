Pat sent me a (http://mythicmktg.fileburst.com/war/us/home/flash/WAR-pp_2007-07_painting.html), after watching it I decided to post it and share what I think is an amazing talent.

I wish I could do that... it always makes me wonder where talent like this comes from.  It's something I think we are born with, but where does that come from?  Why does it manifest itself in various forms throughout the population, and are some of us just talentless?

I don't think so, I think we all have talents, even if they are sometimes hidden, or dormant, until a situations happens and that latent talent manifests itself unconsciously.  Maybe your talent is diffusing arguments before they get out of hand, maybe your talent is making jelly out of sand plums, whatever it is, there is something you are amazing at.  You just have to find it.

Or maybe it will find you.

If you want to share your talent with us, post a comment.
