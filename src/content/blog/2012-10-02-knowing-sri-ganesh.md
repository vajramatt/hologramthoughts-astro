## **Gayatri Mantra**

***Aum Bhur Bhuvah Swah, Tat Savitur Varenyam***
***Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi, DhiyoYo Nah Prachodayat.***

Oh God, the Protector, the basis of all life, Who is self-existent,Who is free from all pains and Whose contact frees the soul from all troubles, Who pervades the Universe and sustains all, the Creator and Energizer of the whole Universe, the Giver of happiness, Who is worthy of acceptance, the most excellent.

Who is Pure and the Purifier of all, let us embrace that  God, so that He may direct our mental faculties in the right direction.

Om Gajananam . . .

## Ganesh Mantra

***Om gajananam, bhoot ganaat sevatam. Kapta jambu fal chaar bakshanam. Uma sutam shok vinash karakam namahmi vighneshvar paadh pankajam***.

"Oh Elephant-faced, worshiped by the existing beings, of all living beings tasting the elephant apple (kaith) and jambolana (jamun), the Son of Uma, destroyer of grief, I bow to the lotus feet of Ganesh, who is lord of all."

This is ganesha mantra or ganesh stotra. 5 times a day or 5 times every wednesday will change your life.
