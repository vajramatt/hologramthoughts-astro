I passed a man on the street this morning. He was walking on the sidewalk, looking down, looking for a bit of money, or maybe a cigarette but that could still hold a light. I imagined him suddenly as a wealthy man, looking ahead as he walked, knowing that the world was his, and that there was no treasure except the one he already has. I thought of those who walk through life looking to the heavens, seeking God for their treasure, yet never looking ahead long enough to value the treasures laid all around them. Their family, their well-being, nature, friendships, loves.  Yes, I do think that spirituality is a lifelong quest, but without seeing the pleasures that the heavens have placed around you, there is no joy here and now. I thought of myself, and my treasures. My children, my wife, my family and friends who are family; how they are all I ever needed, and I am so thankful for them all. \[ad\]
