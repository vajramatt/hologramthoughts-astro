Shri Dhanvantari

Shri Dhanvantre, the celestial healer, the deity of Ayurveda, the easer of pains, and an incarnation of Lord Vishnu himself.

Ayurveda is a spiritual science in itself. It is believed that Ayurveda, as a branch of the Vedas, is a stream of the knowledge passed down from generation to generation since eternity, much in the same way as Vedic literature and the Vedic scriptures were. As the story goes, the knowledge of Ayurveda was created by Brahma, the Creator, who gave it to Prajapati, who passed it to the *Ashwini Kumari* (the celestial Twin Physicians), who in turn passed it down to Indra, and so on.

According to the *Charaka Samhita*, the knowledge of Ayurveda is eternal and is revealed in each of the cycles of creation of the universe. When needed, Lord Vishnu himself incarnates as Lord Dhanvantre and reestablishes the tradition of Ayurveda in the world to help relieve some of humanity’s suffering.

Read through this a few times and then say the mantra below...

> Salutations to him, Lord Dhanvantre, who is holding a conch shell, a disc of energy, a leech, and a pot of celestial ambrosia. In whose heart shines a subtle, clear, gentle, and pleasing blaze of light that also shines around his head and lotus eyes.  
> On the dark blue water his body is luminous, splendid, and shining. His waist and thighs are abounding in bright yellow clothes.  
> Who, by his mere play, destroys all disease like a mighty forest fire.
> 
> Om Dhanvantaraye Namah
