What will it take to make me listen?
What will it take to make me see with out distortion?
What will it take to make me understand,
to make me care,
to make me forgive,
to let me feel love.

What will it take to make me notice,
to make me pay attention,
to calm me down,
to smile again,
to smell the rain and not fear the floods.

What will it take to wake me up?
What will it take to change my ways,
to hear the cries,
to pick them up and set them right,
to hold you through the night?

What will it take to make it right?
What will it take to make me cry?
to make me hate,
to make me beg,
to let you go,
What will it take?
