Spent an extra day trapped in Las Vegas, thank you US Air, but at least it was a nice night at the [MGM Grand](http://www.mgmgrand.com/) again. I was out there working for [Century](http://www.centurymartialarts.com/) at the [Martial Arts Super Show](http://www.masupershow.com/) convention, which is an amazing mix of every martial art you can imagine and the MMA stars as well. I will get some stuff up soon about some thoughts I had while I was out there in the sea of people, but for now here are a few pictures I took while out there.
