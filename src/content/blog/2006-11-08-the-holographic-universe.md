I think it must have been in 1992 when I first read The Holographic Universe. I remember laying on a cot in Pendleton, the sun was beating in on me from the open window. I remember vividly thinking that it made sense, that most of his theories felt right to me.

If you have not already read the book, it is covers the possibility that the universe is actually one hologram. That would imply that the whole is within the part and then inversely that the part is the whole.must have been in 1992 when I first read The Holographic Universe. I remember laying on a cot in Pendleton, the sun was beating in on me from the open window. I remember vividly thinking that it made sense, that most of his theories felt right to me.

Michael Talbot, the author of this work, uses David Bohm's work in quantum physics and Karl Pribam's work in neuroscience to illuminate many areas that are still considered parapsychology and pseudosciences.

At one time Bohm was the physics tutor to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, although when I in itially read the book that meant little to me, now I hold that in much higher esteem.
