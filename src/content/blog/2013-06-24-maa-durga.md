My wife recently read a very nice article in Yoga Journal about meditating upon Durga, the Hindu goddess. This brought me to a meditation sitting before the divine feminine of Durga. I have been familiar with many other incarnations of Devi from my other readings, but Durga is relatively unknown to me.

She is the warrior aspect of the Universal Mother. She is blinding white light made manifest, weapons of the gods in her hands, nothing can stand before her. She wears a shining dress from which emit rays of energy that at once destroy and love. She slays the demons, not sending them to a eternal damnation, but freeing their souls and returning them to moksha with the One.

I will be spending more time with Maa Durga. I am beseaching her energy to come into my being. Her mantra is **Om Aing Hring Kleeng Chamundaya Vichche**. I found this youtube and unless I find a more pleasing version, I will be using this for my mantra chanting as well.
