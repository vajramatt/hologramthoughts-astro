I have been amazed to see how badly American journalists, and the media in general, are distorting the Georgian attacks on South Ossetia, and then the Russian counterattacks.  Why have we not been told the truth about what has happened so far?  From international media you will learn that the Georgian military attacked South Ossetia without provocation.  Georgian military shelled residential areas of the South Ossetian city, Tskhinvali.  This tiny US puppet state, headed by a man who was trained in the US, has brought the US and Russia to the brink of war; and all with the blessing of the American president. (Both American and Israeli advisers are embedded with Georgian troops.) From [The People's Voice](http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/cgi-bin/blogs/voices.php/2008/08/14/p27774 "A Tale of Two Morons")

> Writing in the Asia Times, Ambassador M. K. Bhadrakumar, a former career diplomat in the Indian Foreign Service, notes the disinformation that is being peddled by the Bush Regime and the US media and reports that “at the outbreak of violence, Russia had tried to have the United Nations Security Council issue a statement calling on Georgia and South Ossetia to immediately lay down weapons. However, Washington was disinterested.” Amb. Bhadrakumar notes that the American and Georgian resort to violence and propaganda has brought an end to the Russian government’s belief that diplomacy and good will can bring about a settlement of the South Ossetia issue. If Russia wished, Russia could terminate Georgia’s existence as a separate country at will, and there is nothing the US could do about it.

Does the American government want a base of operations in Eurasia so badly that it will stop at nothing?  Bringing Georgia and the Ukraine into NATO is not the answer.  Basing a new missile system in Poland is not the answer.  Russia will not stand for either of these situations.  Would America let China base missiles in Mexico?
