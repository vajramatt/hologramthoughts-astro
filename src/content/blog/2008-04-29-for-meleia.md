I was dreaming about tomorrow
Floating to the ground on a parachute of cellophane
Trees in my face as I try to put my feet down
Leonard Cohen singing in my head,
telling me about the war raging on.

I was dreaming about yesterday
Sitting in the sun at the kitchen table
Outside, the storm rained and thundered to the beat
Of the song that Death Cab was strumming

I was dreaming about forever
Daikini spun and danced to the music
I stood there, talking to my selves
Understanding what you meant,
Finally.
