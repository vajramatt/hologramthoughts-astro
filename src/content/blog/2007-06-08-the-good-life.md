Last night I was on the living room floor, two of my children were asleep against me, each occupying an arm like a jealous lionesses on a kill.  I was paying more attention to the television than to the two sleeping beauties at my sides, and then the little one turned towards me, smiled and said, "I love you daddy."

Suddenly I was giving them all of my attention.  I carried them both off to their beds, one by one and then I too went to bed, smiling.

I told a friend about it this morning and she said that I have a good life.

She's right.

This morning I walked in to the kitchen, still more asleep than awake, and heard a sound at the back door.  Our dog had pulled the canvas cover off of my grill and was happily chewing another hole into the fabric.  A few years ago this would have sent me in to a rage, but now that kind of thing makes me smile too.

The dog was just doing what he does, can't fault him for that.  I scolded him, pet his head and took away the grill cover.  He was thrilled, I had come outside to spend time with him, that was all that mattered to his little mind.  His soul is kind and loving, no reason to change that.  The kids love just sitting with him and letting him lay his head in their laps.  I do too.

After that I walked around the back yard, barefoot in the lush green grass.  It felt so good on my feet. It felt alive, full of energy and potential.  Everyday magic, you know?  Life is good, be mindful and see that.
