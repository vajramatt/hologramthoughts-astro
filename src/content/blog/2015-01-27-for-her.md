I have been lost amongst the stars
I have been lost among the stars
I have wandered from light to light
I have searched for the right

I have walked upon the shore
I have walked upon the shore
I have seen a new moon rising
I have seen many a starless night

I have flown upon the wing
I have flown in the skies
I have sailed over the seas
I have sailed down the streams

I am ready for the answer
I am ready for your answer
I am holding you now
I will never let you down
