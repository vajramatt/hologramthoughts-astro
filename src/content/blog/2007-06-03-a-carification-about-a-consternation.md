Some one I trust just reminded me that teaching prematurely is a trap. I told him as I have told you in the past; I am not a teacher. What I write here and present to you are my own thoughts backed up solely by my own understanding and reasoning. I am not now, nor will I ever be a true teacher of the Dharma or anything else for that matter. I am someone who likes to discuss subjects of interest to me, and that will not stop. As I say many times in many posts, I am no authority, these are just my thoughts. I have a hard enough time living my own life by a standard I am happy with, much less asking anyone to follow my words or actions. Any way, I just wanted to make sure any one who read my words knew that I in no way am trying to present my self as a teacher of any kind. Peace, Matt
