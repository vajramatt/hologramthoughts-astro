Sometimes I want to scream to beg to plead Sometimes I want to smile to sigh to close my eyes and just be Sometimes I am alone in a room full of people invisible Sometimes my heart is torn swollen and bruised unable to beat Sometimes there is silence even as birds sing because I am without you Sometimes I am hopeful that you will see me that you will welcome me that you will allow Sometimes I am scared.
