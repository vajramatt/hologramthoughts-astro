The gods are as real as you or me, I assure you of this fact\*. They deserve your adoration and acknowledgement, your practice and meditation, but they cannot grant you enlightenment, peace, real happiness. They can offer you their love and support, even their boons, but you must do the work for your self by your self. That adoration I mentioned, you should have that for every being. If you are cruel, or even indifferent, to someone in need, how are you serving them, a god, or yourself? A terrible storm recently took lives near my home, and watching those affected dealing with the tragedy has reminded me that sitting on a cushion chanting mantra is only one aspect of understanding my own nature. My own issues with anger, fear, hate, self-loathing, or whatever, are nothing in comparison to what others are dealing with right now, just a few miles from my home. Many are coming to grips with total loss of all worldly goods, and in some cases, the sudden loss of loved ones. There is nothing that can be done, accept to care for them. Care for them is real ways. Feed them. Clothe them. House them. Hold them. Hug them and listen to their stories when they are ready to talk. Reminds me of the words I learned in mass as a kid, 'whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers, you do unto me'. That is real kindness, real adoration. Yes, I sit on a cushion and I chant my mantra and offer compassion to every being; good, that's great. But I need to do more to show every being that I adore them. I hope that you join me. Namaste. \* I'm no teacher, I'm no one's guru, these are just my understandings and my views.
