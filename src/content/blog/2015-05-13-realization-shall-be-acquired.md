"If a person observes the whole sky, they will realize that space has neither locality nor boundary. Thus they will dispense with such concepts. So when mind and all phenomena are investigated, not so much as an atom of objective substantiality will be found.

Observing this, realization shall be acquired!

Just as the crow that has flown from the ship, after seeking but finding no land, must return, and settle on the ship again, so the mind sent questing by our desires must eventually return, and settle in the unchanging nature of mind itself.

Unmoved by stimuli, free of hope and fear, the hidden motivations destroyed and the root cut—this is the sky-like Vajra-mind itself."
