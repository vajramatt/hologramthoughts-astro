Parapsychology has fascinated me since I was a little guy, and that was a long time ago.   My uncle Richard is a hypnotherapist, spooky stuff to begin with right; when I was in the first grade, so I was maybe six or seven years old, I came home early to my grandparents house with an ear ache.  It was bad, I remember laying on my grandfather's bed, under the covers, tossing and turning.  Richard asked me if I would let him hypnotize me, that maybe it would help the pain.

He called my mom and asked permission before he sat with me, I remember thinking that was strange.  She asked me on the phone if I was OK with him talking to me, again strange.  The guy is my uncle, so why does he have to ask to 'talk' to me...

When he began his voice was different somehow.  Quiet, soft, reassuring - he had taken on a low tone that in itself was mesmerizing.  He talked me down until I was lost somewhere in myself.  He asked me to see what it was in my head that hurt so much.  Once I could 'see' it with my mind, he asked for me to describe the scene to him.

I told him that on a white background I could see little dots moving and wiggling around.  That there were white dots with different colors around them, like jellybeans I think I told him.

These little colored white dots were surrounding the black dots and then making them dissolve.  The black dots are not rounded and symmetrical like the white dots, but rather jagged and lopsided.  I know that the black dots were to me the cause of my pain, while the white dots with the many colors around them were good.

All the while my uncle is talking me through, encouraging me to create more of the  'good dots'  and that they are then coming to help and make the 'bad dots' go away.  He says that this will make my ears feel better and then I can sleep.  I don't know how long this took, but I do clearly remember feeling better and then sleeping.

So here is this little kid, 'seeing' the pressure in his head being release, or destroyed, or whatever, and then feeling better.

What can a guru do?  Someone who has been practicing meditation and mind control for a lifetime, or many lifetimes?  Where are the boundaries they must observe?

We do not have a clue.  Western science, western medicine, even western spirituality thinks that we have all we need, all there is to know somehow.  I think that is crazy talk.

If this little 6 year old was able to see into his own head and to make his headache lessen and then disappear, I mean what can someone who has been training for years do?  I remember reading about the guy who has surgery while in a meditative state, with out any anesthesia. (Still looking for the link.)  Can mankind one day simply kill cancer by thinking about the cancer being destroyed?

I don't know, I am just going to go and think about it though.
