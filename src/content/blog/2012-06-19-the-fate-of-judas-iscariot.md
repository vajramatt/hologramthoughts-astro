I was sent this in an email from a Dharma sister, and I love it.

**Baba Sawan Singh was asked about the fate of Judas Iscariot**

**A Christian missionary once asked Baba Sawan Singh, a great Saint of India, “May I ask another question, if you don’t mind? What has been the lot of Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus? Where is he now?”**

**“Where should he be in your opinion?” asked the Great Master.**

**“Why, I should think he must be suffering hell torture somewhere,” the missionary replied.**

**“No,” said the Great Master. “He is with Lord Jesus Christ, enjoying perfect bliss in His lap.”**

**A loud “Oh!” burst from the lips of all the missionaries. Their leader, the elderly gentleman said, “Wonderful. This is perfectly true.”**

**“This is the way of the Masters,” the Great Master told them. “They never look at our faults. There is no place for hell torture in Mercy and Love.”**

**“Was he not punished for his crime?” asked one of the young missionaries.**

**“His sin was personal against the Lord, and the Lord forgave him,” the Great Master replied.**

This is really one of those messages that sit within my heart, and I cherish it.
