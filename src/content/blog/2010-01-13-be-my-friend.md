Just some random reasons that make me a good friend.

	

- I know how to treat people.  As long as you are a decent person, hey, me too!

	

- strong work ethic. no kidding, i will succeed, and i will drag you along for the ride.

	

- musical tastes that range the spectrum.  Though I worship at the altar of the Almighty Pink Floyd, I love me some Nate Dog and Lady Gaga. (No, I am not gay. That I know of.)

	

- shaved head. Hey, who doesn't need more shaved head and goatee wearing friends?

	

- sweaty palms. Well, only when I am nervous. Crap, I got nervous telling you that, I need a towel. BRB.

	

- I love technology, quesadillas and lamas.

	

- barely a drinker, so you always have a DD. I mean, I might partake in a few little vodka drinks with some fruit juice thrown in, and the occasional umbrella, but hey, who doesn't?

	

- love to cook!

	

- love to eat good food.

	

- can lay in a bed on a rainy afternoon reading all day and only go out to walk the dog... I will even walk your dog. No, that isn't necessarily a euphemism, but take it as you will.

	

- sometimes I can be poetic, or so I am told. I am sure it gets old, but I will let thou judgest.

	

- ability to believe almost any conspiracy theory. Atlantis, why not. Martians living on earth as lizards who rule the countries of the world, sounds plausible. (This makes life way more interesting.)

	

- animal lover. Not that kind, you are sick. Be ashamed. I mean that animals are little souls and I love them.  Animals like me too. Strays follow me when I go for walks. All the dogs in PetSmart want to hang out with the me. It is both, a blessing and a curse.

	

- ninja training. I was in the USMC and physically fit, I was a ninja yo! But, sadly, now I have packed on a few pounds, so I am sumo. I can still protect that which needs it.

	

- seriously, I am a protector.  Evil undead midget clowns better stay the hell away from me. I am afraid of them, and I will hurt them. Not kidding.

	

- massages - no lie, I am great at giving them.

	

- multilingual.  I can pick up your language with speed and agility. Everyone has their own language, so I become an expert in ese.

	

- compassion. Yeah, I got that too!

	

- sometimes I am really funny.  I mean it, I crack myself up all the time. If you don't think I am funny, you suck.

	

- outgoing and friendly. I have never met a stranger I don't welcome as a friend.

	

- hugger - I hug my guy friends and I think that full frontal hugging between male and female friends is appropriate sometimes. I reserve the right to decide this based upon a few factors which I will not go into here.

	

- conversational - I can carry on a conversation about religion, philosophy, history, math and the sciences all night. I can talk about technology, Dungeons and Dragons, and even Strawberry Shortcake too. Yeah, I'm deep.

	

- traveler - I am headed to the Orient soon and I am booking friends who would be good travelers. No whining, adventure seeking, food loving, wine drinking, roughing it in hotels with indoor plumbing friends who want to come-with.

I am pretty sure there is more to be said here, but I don't want to come off as not being humble.

	

- add humble to this list.
