I recently found an article about a Roman Catholic priest who is also an expert in Tibetan Buddhism. He has read and traveled extensively in Tibet, Nepal and India in his quest to understand the spiritual and religious beliefs of that area.\(https://res.cloudinary.com/hologram-thoughts/image/upload/h_300,w_209/v1417391348/padmasambhava_rainbow_body_rrbifs.jpg)](http://res.cloudinary.com/hologram-thoughts/image/upload/v1417391348/padmasambhava_rainbow_body_rrbifs.jpg) Padmasambhava's Rainbow Body\ Fr. Francis encountered writings of early fathers of the Christian church and in the early Buddhist canon that described humans as originally beings of light. *Source: (http://xuanfa.net/articles/the-tibetan-rainbow-body-the-christian-resurrection/?fb_action_ids=10152465766789867&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=other_multiline&action_object_map=%5B140467092769909%5D&action_type_map=%5B%22og.likes%22%5D&action_ref_map=%5B%5D)*Once I read that small bit, I knew that I needed to know more about Father Francis. His [curriculum vitae](http://www.stmchurch.com/tisocv.htm) blew me away, I don't know why I am so surprised that a religious man, a priest, would be fascinated by this aspect of Tibetan Buddhism, but I was. Apparently he began studying the rainbow body phenomenon with support from Rome as it may relate to Jesus' story from the cave. Many credible Christian thinkers have theorized that Jesus' body emitted a large amount of radioactive energy as he moved into his divine being. With there being  documented cases throughout history of Buddhist practitioners leaving their bodies upon 'death' and assuming rainbow bodies, this makes sense for what happened to Jesus if you look at his story from that light. Is that what happened? I don't know, but I do appreciate a Roman Catholic priest investigating it at least.
