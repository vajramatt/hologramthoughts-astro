With a lot of help from (http://www.cerebellum.tv/) we are up and running on WordPress 2.3.  I have had a blog on Blogger for a while now and I grew itchy for some of the functionality that I have on a true web site.  I wanted to categorize posts, create pages, and do general housekeeping that Blogger either did not allow for, or just seemed too tedious on the Blogger engine.  Enter WordPress.

Jason has nagged me for a while to make the switch, and I am very glad I did.  The widget system is amazing and the themes available in the community or wonderful.  I have a lot to learn, but this is great fun.
