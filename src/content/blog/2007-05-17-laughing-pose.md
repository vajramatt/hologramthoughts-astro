This morning on the way to work I was listening to (http://www.npr.org/), there was a story about Lebanon and the damage brought by Israel last year in the "war".  I started to turn the station, not wanting to hear how badly the Israeli's needed to kill more Lebanese, but instead I was blessed with an excellent story about loving-kindness.

[![](https://media.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2007/may/yoga/food200.jpg)](http://media.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2007/may/yoga/food200.jpg)The story focused on a detachment of U.N. peace keepers from  the Punjab region of India.  The taught yoga three times a week at local schools all across southern Lebanon. To listen to the story and read the accompanying piece, see this (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10221166).

The thing that touched me most was at the very end, Lt. Col. Rajesh Kumar, the commanding officer for the detachment tells the children to try the Laughing Pose, to throw their heads back and to laugh out loud.  He told them this would make them feel better.

What a good thing to teach the children in a war ravaged country.  Their neighbors to the south, the Israeli's taught the same children to fear.  Reminds me of a quote from the Buddha.

> Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing  it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.

I think we should listen to the Hindu's on this one for sure.
