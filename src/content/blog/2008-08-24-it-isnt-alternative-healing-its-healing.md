I found [BuddhaHands.com](http://www.buddhahands.com/) while I was looking for some widgets for one of my [Technology Story](http://technologystory.com) articles, and I was thrilled to find the network of 'alternative' healing professionals.  I have believed in these so-called alternative healing methods for years, though I only really began using some of these methods a few years ago.  In Oklahoma you are not surrounded by yogis, acupuncturists, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, Reikis, or Ayurvedic doctors.  Luckily I found a couple that I could trust here in Oklahoma City, OK. I actually met my friend Gardner Singleton via email.  My judo Sensei, [Nick Lowry](http://www.windsongdojo.com "Nick Lowry with Windsong Dojo"), knew Gardner from the dojo where Gardner had introduced himself and practiced Tibetan Buddhism with a local sangha that met in the dojo.  Once Nick had sent me Gardner's email address I began to ask him questions about Chi Gung, acupuncture, and Tai Chi.  It was amusing actually, he is a busy guy, with two offices and a thriving practice he was less than thrilled to be answering questions from some guy he had never met. So I bit the bullet and went into his OKC office for a session of needles and chatting.  I still remember him asking me what I was seeing him for, what I needed him to cure or lessen, and I smiled and told him I just wanted to experience acupuncture.  It was awesome.  I was hooked.  I am a acupuncture junky, I would seriously, no kidding, spend a lot of money on those needles just because of the stress relief they offer.  If you want to contact Gardner just go to his web site, [East Healing Arts](http://www.easthealingarts.com/ "East Healing Arts").  If you aren't local to Oklahoma City he can still offer you help by prescribing traditional Chinese herbal remedies. So, back to the Buddha Hands site.  They have a huge selection of widgets that teach you about healing methods that might seem foreign to you, that may even seems fantastical, but they work.  The proof is in the 5000+ years of history that surround them. Check out this reiki widget and play with it a while:  I wanted to embed this [acupuncture widget](http://www.clearspring.com/widgets/48792306c5bbfb20?p=489aad84420dd84c), but it is too wide for my blog, so click on the link and check it out.
