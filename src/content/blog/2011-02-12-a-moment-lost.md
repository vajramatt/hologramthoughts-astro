It was happening again, between her breathes she was immortal. Every leaf in the trees stood motionless. Birds stopped mid-flight, frozen in the air before her.

From time to time she felt like the whole universe was waiting for her next move, as if all of creation was watching her and holding its breath until she moved on to her next thought. Suddenly the heavens would rotate again, and the laws of physics would resume.

That seemed like a crazy thought, but she had it, nonetheless.

She stood near the window for a moment and then moved back into the dark bedroom. Only the glow of the fireplace lit her surroundings as she crawled back into her bed. Once she was under her covers again she glanced back to the window, out into the snowy woods beyond the yard. It was there within the woods that she had first felt as if she was at the center of the whole universe. It was a heady feeling to contain everything within your soul, and though she loved that feeling it sent her into a quiet panic for a few minutes those first few times.
