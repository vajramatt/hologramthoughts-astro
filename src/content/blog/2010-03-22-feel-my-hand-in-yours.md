The soft sounds of the television find their way down the hallway.  My son is asleep, but I have yet to make it to his room to turn off the T.V. and cover him up.  I will tuck him in every night that I can, one day he will move out, and I don't want to regret missing a night.  The boxer is snoring loudly beside me, I am about to begin my meditations, tonight is Tonglen, and I am going to focus on some one who was a close friend last year.  She has strayed into some deep water, and I hope she corrects soon. Before though, just a bit of stream of consciousness writing I think. :) Take me in right away and finish this deed, take my hands and show me to the sun, show me the willows and the bends in the road. Take me to the top of the hill and then throw me off, let the angels catch me if they will let them float me down beside you if they will. Take me with you when you leave is there somewhere I am not allowed to go is there somewhere I am not allowed to see? Please, feel my hand in yours, please hold me up, please make the shadows run away. Please.
