*The Prayer That Appearances Be Liberated As the Deity*

*That Sounds Be Liberated As Mantra*

*That Thoughts Be Liberated Into Pure Being*

* * *

All these forms that appear to eyes that see,

All things on the outside and the inside,

The environment and its inhabitants

Appear, but let them rest where no self's found;

Perceiver and perceived when purified

Are the body of the deity, clear emptiness --

To the guru for whom desire frees itself,

To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.

 

All these sounds that appear for ears that hear,

Taken as agreeable or not,

Let them rest in the realm of sound and emptiness,

Past all thought, beyond imagination;

Sounds are empty, unarisen, and unceasing,

These are what make up the Victor's teaching --

 

To the teachings of the Victor, sound and emptiness,

To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.

 

All these movements of mind towards its objects.

These thoughts that make five poisons and its afflictions,

Leave thinking mind to rest without contrivances.

Do not review the past nor guess the future.

If you let such movement rest in its own place,

It liberates into the dharmakaya --

 

To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.

 

Grant your blessing that purifies appearance

of objects perceived as being outside.

 

Grant your blessing that liberates perceiving mind,

the mental operation seeming inside.

 

Grant your blessing that between the two of these

Clear light will come to recognize its own face;

 

In your compassion, sugatas of all three times,

Please bless me that a mind like mine be freed.
