> Lets do it. Lets live forever. I need a thousand lifetimes today so I'm going to believe they exist.

I was transported to 1986 again. Queen was singing the song 'Who Wants To Live Forever' from the Highlander soundtrack to me again. I saw the movie more than a few times in the theater at my local mall, and then I bought the soundtrack at the record store. I bought it on tape, and I wore it out. Freddy Mercury amazed me on that album, like on everything he ever did. Who wants to live forever? Well, me. I do. Not in this incarnation, but I do want to live forever. I want to see stars born and worlds come to life with intelligence and hope. I want to be a part of everything, everywhere. I want to become more than I am now, I want to merge with the one lone Awareness. \[youtube\]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEZYm7s-54Q\[/youtube\] Om Namah Shivaya.
