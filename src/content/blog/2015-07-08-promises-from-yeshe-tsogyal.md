"What we understand to be phenomena
Are but the magical projections of the mind.
The hollow vastness of the sky
I never saw to be afraid of anything.
All this is but the self-glowing light of clarity.
There is no other cause at all.
All that happens is but my adornment.
Better, then, to stay in silent meditation."
~ Yeshe Tsogyal

 

"If you know me, you know that I reside in the hearts of all beings. Just summon me and I will return!"
~ YesheTsogyal
