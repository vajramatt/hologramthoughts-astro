Last night I woke many times during this dream. Each time I woke I thought to myself that I needed to finish the dream and I wanted to continue it.

> I am not sure of the dates, but I know I am aboard an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. The war is over and we are celebrating with every one on the deck. Parties and music and drinking, the mood is amazing and elated. At one point in my dream I stopped and just watched everyone around me. I know these guys, we're like brothers now. I know about their home life, their families and their dreams for when they get home. I have flown missions with them day and night, known that I was protected by them as I did the same. It seems surreal, the music coming out over the loud speaker, the happiness and then I stopped myself and wondered if I was dreaming of a past life. That is sobering in a dream, to realize you are dreaming and wonder what it all means. Then, as I was day-dreaming in my dream, I am handed orders to fly in to a small town and wait for orders. My dream changes and now I am just about to land my Mustang on a dirt road behind a B-17. As soon as my wheels are down the engine is dead and I coast the plane behind a very large barn. We tarp both of the planes, my Mustang is swallowed by one gray tarp, the B-17 takes as many as we can steal form the barn. After we had finished the tarping we found work clothes in the barn and traded out our Navy shirts for plain shirts, keeping our own shoes and pants. We walked down the dirt road we had landed on and headed in to the small town. Along the way I realized that there were no electrical wire lines. I don't know what cities looked like in the 1940s really, but to my eye, that seemed very odd. As we got in to the small town I saw a couple of houses with electric lamps in their windows. I remember that we are here to get someone out of the town and that we were supposed to fly in, pick them up and then turn around and fly out in one day. I now have the understanding that it is the 1890s and that the plan is gone. The person I was to rendezvous with won't even be born for another 20 years.

I woke up there this morning, wishing I knew more of the story. Did I ever find the person in the small town? Was I looking for me? Am I the guy in the 1940s and someone in the 1890s? Good questions, no answers.
