I, Yeshe Tsogyal, am the sovereign of cyclic existence and its transcendence.  If you recognize me, I live in the minds of all beings; I emanate as the natural elements and sense-fields; though primordially we are not separate, not recognizing me, you experience me externally. Afterwards, I abided evenly in the view of the Great Perfection beyond all action, and as the experience dawned on me wherein all phenomena are extinguished in the nature of reality, I was perceived in various forms according to the needs of beings. To the hungry I was heaps of food and all good things, and thus I brought them joy. To the cold and freezing I was fire and sun-warmth, thus their joy. To the poor and needy I was wealth and riches, thus their joy. To the naked I was every kind of raiment, thus their joy. To the childless I was sons and daughters, thus their joy. To those who craved a woman, I became a lovely girl and thus their joy. To those who sought a lover, I was a handsome youth and thus their joy. To those who wanted magic powers, I gave prowess in the eight great siddhis, and thus I brought them joy. To the sick I was their remedy and thus their joy. To the anguished I was all their mind desired, and thus I was their joy. To those in fear of savage beasts, I was a haven, thus their joy. To those who fell into the depths, I was their drawing out and thus their joy. To those tormented in the fire, I was a quenching stream and thus their joy. To those in prey to any of the elements, I was their medicine and thus their joy. For those who could not see, I was their eyes and brought them joy. And for the halt and crippled I was feet and thus their joy. I was a tongue for those who could not speak, and thus I brought them joy. To those in fear of death I granted immortality, and thus I was their joy. I led the dying on the path of transference and brought them joy. To those who wandered in the bardo state, I was their yidam, bringing them to joy. I cooled the burning heat and warmed the cold of those lost in the realms of hell. Howsoever they were tortured, I changed myself to shield them, being thus their joy. I shielded all from everything that tortured them and was their every joy. ~Yeshe Tsogyal, from “The Sky Dancer,” Translated by Keith Dowman (A note from Matt: I saw this posted on Facebook by my friend, Amrita Nadi, and though I have read The Sky Dancer, this was posted and perfectly timed for me on this very day.)
