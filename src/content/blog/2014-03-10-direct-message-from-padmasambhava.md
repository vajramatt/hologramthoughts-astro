I guess it isn't anything new for me to hear mantra while I dream, I mean I do say mantra as I fall asleep most nights, but the difference is that I was not saying Padmasambhava's mantra as I fell asleep. I am not well versed with the teachings of this Tibetan saint. I know a little of his story, that he came to Tibet in the 8th century AD. I know that he did magical warfare with the demons of the land that had plagued the people of Tibet, converting them to being Dharma Protectors and swearing them to oaths that they would protect the Dharma and practitioners. To learn more about him visit the wiki page [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmasambhava "Wiki Padmasambhava"). I have found this page very useful for understanding what the actual mantra is bringing about, [Vajra Guru Mantra](http://www.rinpoche.com/gurumantra.html). I asked two good friends, both strong Vajrayana practitioners what this meant and for their thoughts. One explained to me that I needed to view this as a call from Padmasambhava himself. A 'direct message' if you will. My other friend sad the same and then he asked for me to practice in this manner:

Learn to visualize his form, smiling, with some clarity in the space before you. When you can stabilize the general image begin working on details; I.E., his earrings, eyes, fingers, hat, patterns on the brocade robe, etc., - all of this to accompany the mantra.

"When you're finished, dissolve the visualization into a sphere of white light with a reddish glow around the edges, and draw it into your heart center. Mediate in the nondual nature of mind for as long as you can, and then dedicate merit to all sentient beings."

~ Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche

These two men that I am seeking guidance with are wonderful, and I cannot thank them enough. So, now I am learning more and I accept the call to practice his mantra. It is beautiful, and it is this:

*Om Ah Hum Vajra Guru Pema Siddhi Hum*

To get the cadence down I am using this video: \[youtube\]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynSWoeQYsTE\[/youtube\]   Namaste.
