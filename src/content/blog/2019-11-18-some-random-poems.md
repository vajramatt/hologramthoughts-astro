## I’ve seen this before

I’ve dreamed through the clouds and set the stars alight. I’ve stepped from  
mountain to mountain  
and splashed in oceans on planets  
far from here.

I’ve swam in skies and walked beneath the gem-studded ceilings of the gods. Devas flew beside me and offered me advice to keep you.

The taste of your honey is known to me. The way your skin blushes under my lips.

Like diamonds  
Your eyes are endless.

## Pirouette

Pirouette and flail  
Until all balance is lost  
Fall into me and I’ll dissolve  
And become the in between of you

Speak and my flesh becomes real  
Ask and my secrets are revealed  
Incantations of laughter and sighs  
The universe in your eyes
