She is the raging storm, I am the dew on the grass. She is the sun itself, I am the reflection from the prayer bowl. She is the ocean and I am lost on her waves. She is the flame, I am the the dry branch. She is the night sky, and I am the cloud reaching higher. She is the dawn and I am the comforted child. She is the total.
