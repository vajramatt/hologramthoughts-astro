*This is a dream I had last night, as I recall it...*

The scene looks like a university setting, on an open grassy area between many red brick buildings.  The buildings are camouflaged with ivy and ancient oaks, making them seem to fade in and out of existence in the leaf-sway on the breeze, only the lights from their myriad windows making them seem real.  A large group of people is gathered around a circle of benches on this cloudless moonlit night, they are listening to someone tell them about something, it all seems very important as I walk toward them.

I want between the benches and around those who sit on the grass, dodging flip-flops and beer cans and I move in to the center, on a mission.

"Are you ready?" the speaker asks me as I approach.

"One last thing I need still," I say, pointing up at a building in the distance.

"Well," he says turning to look across the lawn, "be quick about it then."

I find myself standing now in a giant library.  Dusty books line dimly lit shelf after shelf.  I move over them, searching for a tome that I know must be here, but I cannot find it.  I grow frantic, pulling massive old books from the shelves and dropping them onto the floor in loud, dust exploding, bang and bang.  I open cover after cover, reading the first few sentences of each book seeking what I need, never quite finding the right story, until finally I understand.

I realize what I need to explain to the group below on the grass, and I race toward the stairs...but there I am stopped cold.  The stairs are too steep to climb down, and it is too far down below to jump safely.

Paralyzed with fear I stare out the windows at the group around the circle of benches, unable to reach them.
