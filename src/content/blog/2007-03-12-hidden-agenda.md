We all have a hidden agenda. Whether we want to admit it or not we are trying to make our life in our own image. Sometimes we are honest and we tell people that we seek a certain outcome within a given situation, sometimes we just try to manipulate people and events so that we get our way. We are all suffering and we want to change that somehow. I want a raise, I want a promotion, I want him/her to like me, I want this, I want that. There are a lot of situations in life where we as individuals try to exert our own will upon people and therefore gain control of the event. Why? Do we really think we will be happier if we get 'our' way? Will this magically make something in our life better? What if we just for a moment actually took stock of our life and realized we can be happy even now. The 'I' a few paragraphs above that I mentioned, who is that? If we believe that Buddha-Nature is the essence of our experience then we can find happiness in all situations. If we are mindful of the here and now, if we remain calm and allow ourselves to be in the moment any hidden agenda will find itself useless and fade away. Remember that the 'You' is just a series of thoughts and feelings. Know that you are not who you were yesterday and you have no idea who you will be tomorrow. Life changes and you change with it. I think it was Dan Millman that said we should "stop trying to be superior in an ordinary realm, and start trying to be ordinary in a superior realm." Remember that there is ordinary magic in everything. Kids laughing, butterflies flapping and the wind, all of these are magic and perfect; with out you having any control over them at all. Drop your agendas, see reality and live.
