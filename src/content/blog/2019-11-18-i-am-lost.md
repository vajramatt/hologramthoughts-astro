I am lost

Nothing to see

Nothing to touch

Nothing to hold

To taste

To feel

To be

No walls make this prison cell

No bars on no windows

No chains on my ankles

No keys to find

No locks

Yet I am shackled

To this notion which cannot free me

To this emotion which I cling to

To this idea

I am lost

Do not seek me

Do not wonder

Or worry

Or shed tears

For I was never here

Anyway
