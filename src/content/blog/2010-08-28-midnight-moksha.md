The crescendo, a calamity of sound and light, deafening and silent as it rose into the air above his head.  Rays of azure light shot out of the mist as it began to accelerate, higher than the tree tops now, moving in to the clear air, powered only by his thoughts of freedom.  Drops of plasma, pure, super-heated liquidized energy, shot out of the cloud in every direction and immediately began to fall back toward Earth.  Moving faster and faster now his thoughts become expansive, the 'him' thins into nothingness as the 'I am' becomes all.

His body, still sitting beneath the trees, lit only by his small dhuni fire, rests peacefully in sublime consideration for the all that he has realized.
