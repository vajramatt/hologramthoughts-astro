Guru Senge Dradrok subdues the irrational energies of black magic, curses & hexes, dispelling bad omens, weird vibes, nightmares, or anything that might be too far out there. In Orissa, he destroyed a lingam with a bolt from his fingertips, ending animal sacrifices in the area. He symbolizes the power to neutralize both visible and invisible beings and to avert natural disasters. The wrathful display of Guru 'Lion's Roar' is totally grounded in love and compassion for all sentient beings.
