My sister Ashley, and her husband, are selling their beautiful home in the Belle Isle area of OKC. I am including a slideshow below and the information on how to contact them for more details. I love this home and will be sad to see it outside of the family, but it is a great place, and a wonderful price. Click on the image below to see photos of the house.
